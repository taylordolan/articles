      <p>Dune: Imperium grabbed my attention when I first played it last year, and it hasn’t let go. I recently decided I’d played it enough times to try to collect a picture of how it does what it does. That led both to this review and now also to this interview.</p>
      <p>Anyone who’s used the BGG Dune: Imperium forums knows that Paul Dennen, the designer of Dune: Imperium, is a helpful and polite answerer of rules questions. Look in the right threads and you may also see his thoughtful and easygoing responses to questions about, for example, imperium row “stagnation” and the variants that players have proposed around that.</p>
      <p>I reached out to Paul to see if he would be willing to answer some questions about his process designing the game. And he was! Major props are due: he answered a lot of questions in a lot of depth. I really appreciate the time that he spent on it (and his coworkers’ time, as he ran his answers by them), and I hope you do too!</p>
      <p>One thing I want to make clear from the outset. This is not going to be the sort of conversation where I bring up commonly-discussed aspects of Dune: Imperium and ask whether he agrees with what (some) players think. Instead, my goal here is to open a window into the design process, which means starting from Paul’s perspective and exploring out from there. I hope for this interview to help illuminate what goes into designing a game.</p>
      <p>Again, many thanks to Paul and Dire Wolf for taking time for this interview, as well as for creating and supporting the game more generally. Here’s the interview.</p>
      <p>Q: I want to start with a fun question. Tell us about your favorite things in Dune: Imperium! Favorite leader (from base game / Rise of Ix)? Favorite imperium card? Favorite tech?</p>
      <p>Count Ilban and Paul Atreides are probably my favorite leaders in the base game. What can I say? I like drawing cards. I also like visiting the Mentat, so Duke Leto is another favorite. And once you add Rise of Ix, Leto and the Beast become really interesting for their ability to gain a round 1 dreadnought. I’ve never actually hit the dream opening with the Beast of turn 1 Wealth, turn 2 Dreadnought and acquire Artillery, but I like that it’s a possibility. For cards, I'm actually a big fan of some of the one-cost cards that we've seen a handful of players discussing. I have a very good record with Sardaukar Infantry, for example. And Scout. These cards are incredibly good at allowing you to bully and control the battlefield in the early and midgame, and reap significant conflict rewards. In Rise of Ix, I like Court Intrigue because I like the ability to cycle an Intrigue card and Negotiated Withdrawal because feinting is fun. Ixian Engineer is quite fun, trying to time your tech purchases properly to gain that victory point on reveal before the game ends. For tech tiles, I really enjoy Spy Satellites and how it gives you a different play pattern to pursue.</p>
      <p>Q: Let's talk about the overall process and timeline of the game’s design. How did you get started? How long did it take before you got to something structurally similar to the final version? How much more development work did you do after that?</p>
      <p>We had signed a deal to produce a deck-building game based on Dune. As the biggest Dune fan on the design team and an established deck-building designer, I was happy to take the lead on coming up with a design for the game. The rest of the design and development team had other projects to work on while I was doing the initial ideation for “the Dune game.”</p>
      <p>Within a week or two, I had a design (and rudimentary prototype) that was closer to a traditional deck-building game. This version shared some similarities to the final version in that the Fremen, Bene Gesserit, Spacing Guild, and Emperor were non-player factions that players would vie for via diplomacy.</p>
      <p>After a little rapid prototyping and iteration, I came to the conclusion that it wasn't a good enough game. It was solid, but it didn't feel like it introduced enough innovation. As a Dune fan since the mid 80s, I had a really high quality bar for this project. So, I took a break from the project for a week or two and asked the design team if anyone was interested in taking a crack at it. I wanted to be the game’s designer, but if someone had a better design, I would have gladly stepped aside and played the role of developer. Another team member came up with an interesting game idea, but when we tested it, it suffered from not being a good enough thematic match for Dune.</p>
      <p>This initial prototyping phase took over a month, during the early summer of 2019.</p>
      <p>It would be another few months before we entered what I would call development, because there was still a lot of design work to do and quality bar to aim for. And then a few months of development work, although that was slowed down and stretched out because of Covid.</p>
      <p>Q: Do you draw a clear line between “design” and “development” phases in a way that affects your work processes, or is that more of a retrospective description? What are the criteria for that switchover?</p>
      <p>Definitely not a clear-cut thing. I find it useful to break up the whole cycle into about four phases. Here's a potentially useful "phases and phrases" breakdown.</p>
      <p>(1) Early/system design: coming up with the foundation of the game ("these systems sound like they have synergy with each other")</p>
      <p>(2) Design: exploring and finding various ways to build upon that foundation ("what if we tried THIS cool idea?")</p>
      <p>(3) Design-Development: still lightly exploring but mostly focusing and fleshing out the play patterns that seem the most 'healthy' ("this is a fun activity that should get more focus")</p>
      <p>(4) Final Development: streamlining, balancing, adjusting ("these cards seem dangerous, let's discuss and tweak")</p>
      <p>The broad criterion for switching to the next phase is, as silly as it sounds, being happy with the current state of things. So, move on from foundation building when you think you've got a good foundation. Move to design-development after you feel like you've done a pretty extensive exploration. But there are always exceptions. For example, the game in general might have moved on to the next phase, but there's a straggler. That could be something like "I still wish I'd found a Bene Gesserit card that felt truer to the concept of the Test of Humanity. I'm still exploring possibilities there even though we're otherwise ready to enter final development."</p>
      <p>Q: Did you have any breakthrough moments where a new idea caused the game to suddenly come together?</p>
      <p>After the first round of designs, I challenged myself again to come up with a new game structure that would be a better thematic match to Dune. I wanted to push the concepts of having private information (something that was in my original design, but wanted to push further) and biding your time / choosing the right time because I felt those would resonate with the source material and we were missing those types of feelings in our early attempts.</p>
      <p>The idea of having private information was realized in the Intrigue cards. My first design allowed players to collect tokens that represented the four factions, and each token could be revealed for a specific power related to that faction. That was fun, but not as fun or replayable as having a wide variety of abilities included in a special deck.</p>
      <p>Pursuit of biding your time / choosing the right time led to the idea that we (players) should be playing one card at a time from our hands rather than playing our entire hands. As with the common idiom, I didn't want players to literally "tip their hands" to each other; I wanted them to wonder what others had and were planning to do. This in turn led to the core combat mechanism in the game, as one of the main tension points for how you play your cards, when you play them, and where.</p>
      <p>By the way, it’s not always the case with licensed products, but we were very fortunate to get a lot of great support along the way from Genuine Entertainment and Legendary, who were willing to trust us and let us switch gears on the design mid-process.</p>
      <p>From these starting breakthroughs, other breakthroughs followed rather naturally. The split cards and the difference between agent and reveal turns were, in my mind, an elegant way to integrate deck-building, hand management, and worker placement, and gave players a good amount of agency over how they played out their turns and rounds.</p>
      <p>Q: Players only get to see the final product, and it feels to us like a single, indivisible thing. But aspects of a game are always changing up until the end. Were there any big changes that came relatively late?</p>
      <p>Depends on your definition of big, but I'll list some of the changes that I remember happening during mid-development:</p>
      <p>1) Rally Troops had two modes for a long time. At one point, you could choose 3 Solari for 3 troops or 6 Solari for 5 troops. We settled on one mode because the added complexity of the two modes wasn’t seeing a good enough return in terms of fun.</p>
      <p>2) Hardy Warriors cost 1 spice instead of 1 water. It was initially 1 spice because of symmetry within the factions: each faction had one free space and one spice space. Justin Cohen suggested that we could change the cost to water and it would be more thematic (the Fremen don't need you to pay them spice, they’re surrounded by it; what they value is water) and that was a great point. An irrefutable, watertight point if you will. </p>
      <p>3) Foldspace was “discard a card to draw two cards;” there was no Foldspace card. The power level was a bit too high for a free space, and I felt like there was opportunity to hit the theme a little better (although I did enjoy how discarding a card to draw two cards did feel somewhat like you were navigating through time-space), so I devised the Foldspace special card that could be acquired by visiting the Foldspace board space. The “draw two” effect moved to the Bene Gesserit, who’d had a problematic board space for a while. (And trashing moved out of Research Station to combine with the “draw two” effect to form Selective Breeding.)</p>
      <p>Q: Less big than some I’ve seen, but certainly fascinating! It’s fun, as someone pretty familiar with the published game, to try to imagine how the game might play differently if Foldspace drew cards or Research Station trashed. What exactly did Research Station do back then?</p>
      <p>Research Station trashed a card to draw three cards. It was configured like that so that it would be more compelling to go there in the early game; drawing three cards isn’t as powerful in the early game, but trashing is more powerful. But we found that it was a bit too powerful and took away from the core spice collection subgame. Moving the trash ability to Selective Breeding was a good move. I like how that space has relevance throughout most of the game, and it elevates the importance of having some spice on hand.</p>
      <p>Q: How do you like to go about balancing various game components (cards, board spaces, etc)? Do you have a spreadsheet with baseline values for how much a water is “worth”, how much a card draw is “worth”, etc? Do you track playtesting stats? To what extent is it by feel vs by math vs by data?</p>
      <p>I did track playtesting stats. But while I value math and data, I value feel even more as long as you're doing the work and making proper comparisons and testing things properly. Playtesting stats can only do so much during a game's creation, because you're always changing rules and cards, so the data tends to become old and irrelevant very quickly. At Dire Wolf, we're fortunate to have a group of very high-level card players, so we're generally good at game balance. But I also hosted some pizza and game nights with some of the wider Dire Wolf gamers, to obtain first play and second play statistics.</p>
      <p>Justin, my co-developer, came up with a chart of how much the various resources are worth but even that sparked some amount of debate. As with many games, and in my opinion some of the best games, you have to be aware that the value of certain resources fluctuates during the game. The clearest example in Dune: Imperium is that Solari is quite valuable early but tails off in the end game. One of the typical design patterns for deck-building games is to be aware of early game card “ceilings” (what can a card do at its best) and not let them break the game, and adjust cards so that they're not leaning too heavily toward pure early game (at worst, breaks the game early, or otherwise can be ignored on the row in the mid-game) or pure late game (very bad if it appears early, will shorten the row in the early game).</p>
      <p>Q: Cool, so it sounds like you do a lot of in-house playtesting, and are able to turn that directly into updates to the game. Can I pry a bit more into what that looks like?</p>
      <p>Discussion while playtesting comes with some common sense guidelines. If we enter a playtest with a specific focus on a particular sub-system, then discussing that sub-system during the game is actively encouraged. For example, let's say we added a Landsraad board space for a playtest. It's great if players talk about why they decided NOT to visit that space this turn when they could have. For example, someone might say something like "The opportunity cost was just too high. By going here to Arrakeen, instead, I can probably get a better buy and earn a decent reward from the Conflict, which I'd miss out on if I went to that new space."</p>
      <p>Sometimes discussion during playtesting can be distracting, though. If you've got a relatively minor issue with the balance of a particular card, it's not worth the group's time to have a five minute discussion on that card as it compares to similar cards, in the middle of a game. Just take a note and we can discuss that in post-game feedback, or you can put it into an email where you're listing several questionable card configurations.</p>
      <p>Post-game feedback is the bread-and-butter of our playtesting and development process. After every game, I typically shut up and let everyone give their feedback and personal experience of the game. We'll sometimes come up with solutions to problems that may have come up in that game, but often there is no clear solution because there's an obvious danger of "the cure is worse than the disease" at play with a lot of potential ideas. And sometimes, the cause of the problem isn't obvious. It wouldn't be unusual to receive an email from a playtester a few hours or a day later where that player had a revelation. Example: "You know, I was thinking about the frustration I had, and I'm wondering if there might not be enough low-cost Bene Gesserit cards in the card file. Or maybe there are too many BG cards that combo with each other and not enough simple BG cards?"</p>
      <p>Emails are also common practice for our process at Dire Wolf. During Rise of Ix, I made a ton of leader designs (several of them being variations on a theme to try to find the best variant) and "tested" them by emailing them to the development team and requesting feedback before playtesting them, to get both appeal and power level estimations from everyone. Why spend hours playtesting something that people dislike in principle, or where there is a consensus that something is too weak or too powerful?</p>
      <p>Q: What's your approach to balancing leaders? Did you try to make them all equally strong?</p>
      <p>Equally strong is not a super realistic goal because there will always be some that are slightly stronger or weaker than others. I wanted them to be close in power level, distinct in play patterns, employ mechanics that were thematically resonant with the source material, and supportive of a range of player types and aspirations.</p>
      <p>Q: What’s an example of leaders supporting different player types?</p>
      <p>Sure. As mentioned above, I emailed various Rise of Ix leader designs to the development team for feedback. It wasn’t unusual for most people on the team to say something neutral to negative about a leader, but at the same time for one person to think that same leader was incredibly cool. Ilesa Ecaz and Tessia Vernius fell into this category, if I recall correctly. Some players don’t want that kind of complexity, and others embrace unusual mechanisms.</p>
      <p>Another example would be that some players don’t mind taking a leader that gives them clear guidance and a focus to pursue during the game. Count Ilban and Prince Rhombur fall into that category. “I’m Rhombur, of course I’m getting a dreadnought. To battle!” Other players value gameplay flexibility and being able to pivot depending on what cards are available, what opponents are doing, etc. When designing, it’s good to be able to empathize with a variety of player types and create things you think they’ll enjoy.</p>
      <p>Q: The imperium deck is stuffed with an abundance of cards that all feel distinct from each other. What was your process for designing those cards?</p>
      <p>A pretty big question that I could probably dedicate an entire day or even a week of writing.  I'll attempt the super short bullet point version:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Resonate with source material.</li>
      <li>Support core play patterns.</li>
      <li>Create cards that offer new play patterns and divergent strategies.</li>
      <li>Playtest to see how effective the card file is doing. Throw out things that don't work, keep things that work. Add cards for play patterns that need more support. Invent cards to create or support exciting moments.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Q: Yeah, it’s hard to imagine how much work must have gone into all those cards. I will try not to take up a week, but I do have a couple followup questions about it. First, how did the initially designed deck for the worker placement version of the game come to be?</p>
      <p>I had to start from scratch for the worker placement version of the game. But card ideas and creation came quickly. I don't remember how many cards were in the first playtest. Maybe 50? That amount ballooned up to a high number within a week or two. Maybe to 90-100 max? Reason being that you simply don't fully understand the systems of a game early in the design process, and it's best to not restrain yourself too much in exploring ideas. I'd much rather have too many ideas in an early playtest than be too focused. Let other designers participate in separating the wheat from the chaff, through actual gameplay. Learning for the whole team becomes accelerated when you have comparison points to discuss.</p>
      <p>Here's an example of one of the early cards that, in retrospect, shows that, early on, I didn't fully understand the nuances of what was going to be more fun vs. less fun inside the game's structure:</p>
      <p>
      Liet Kynes<br>
      Cost: 5<br>
      Agent Icons: Emperor Fremen<br>
      Agent Box: You may spend 2 spice to gain an extra influence where you send your Agent.<br>
      Reveal Box: 3 persuasion
      </p>
      <p>Players found it distasteful to chase an alliance against a player who had Liet Kynes in their deck. Thus, the lesson was learned that repeatable "double gain" on a faction track were just not that fun. Meanwhile, the card file at the time also had Power Play, so players would have been able to point at that as an example of a more fun and fair “double gain." That lesson also ended up applying to Firm Grip, which at one point allowed the player to spend 2 Solari to gain Influence on ANY track, including the Emperor track.</p>
      <p>Q: Another followup question - what do you mean by adding cards “for play patterns that need more support”? Can you give an example?</p>
      <p>The clearest example in Dune: Imperium is Bene Gesserit synergy. This type of play pattern requires a certain density of cards in the card file for it to be a satisfying pursuit. This is why the Bene Gesserit have a full 25% stake in the Imperium deck, whereas you'll only find about 15% Emperor, 15% Spacing Guild, and 19% Fremen. Similarly, adding the Fremen tag to the always-available card ("Arrakis Liaison") was a thing that happened during the Design phase, which lessened the amount of pressure on supporting Fremen Bond in the Imperium deck.</p>
      <p>Q: The imperium row has only 5 cards compared to e.g. Clank!’s 6, and just 2 stacks of purchasable reserve cards. You mentioned in your design diary that Dune: Imperium started off as more of a deckbuilding game before evolving to its final form - did these aspects get trimmed back when you added the worker placement elements? Did you ever consider having another reserve card or a bigger row?</p>
      <p>Yeah, I think my first take on a Dune deck-builder had more card choices, and that did feel natural because the game was a pure deck-builder. But, yes, once we went to hybrid deck-building and worker placement, we tested both 6- and 5-card rows. I felt that the 6-card row, along with all the places on the board that players had to learn and be aware of, was unnecessary complexity and that the game played better with a 5-card row.</p>
      <p>Q: The Rise of Ix imperium cards seem slightly stronger than base cards to me, on average. Was that your intention? How did you think about expanding the deck?</p>
      <p>It was intentional to raise the average appeal of Rise of Ix Imperium cards relative to base cards. We’ve seen some of the aforementioned feedback that some players are dismissive of the power level of certain low-cost cards in the base game, and that may be because the power level of those cards was too subtle. With Ix I designed cards that were more obviously good, especially at the 1-cost slots. Because of this, there might be an appearance of power creep, but in my mind, it was more about appeal than actual power, if that makes sense.</p>
      <p>Q: That’s interesting. I certainly agree that the cards being appealing is important and valuable. And I think you succeeded - the Rise of Ix cards are certainly appealing - but I would say that this goal was primarily accomplished by actually making them stronger. Would you disagree with that?</p>
      <p>I don’t agree, but part of our job is making a system where it’s possible for disagreements to exist. If it were easy to precisely evaluate how strong every card was, the game would be pretty boring.</p>
      <p>Q: I was surprised to learn after a few games, when I looked through the intrigue deck, that there were only 2.5 endgame cards in the whole 40-card deck. Why is that?</p>
      <p>I had four or five in the first batch of intrigue cards, but a couple were cut during development, as they simply didn't pass muster with the development team. We could have made some changes to get more in, but I was also very aware of a complexity budget with the game, and a bit concerned about having multiple split-card configurations in the base game, Tiebreaker is the sole exception because it is such a simple configuration. I also didn't want to have more than two pure Endgame Intrigue cards because if you draw too many of them, you can feel frustrated by the Intrigue hand limit.</p>
      <p>With an expansion, you have a higher complexity budget, because there's an expectation that the majority of the players have played the base game and are ready for more. Rise of Ix introduces three more endgame Intrigue cards and two of them use a split-card implementation, which keeps the ratio of pure Endgame cards low (around the same ratio as the base game, 2 of 40 became 3 of 57).</p>
      <p>Q: In Rise of Ix, you took care to replace existing board spaces with new ones, rather than changing the number of board spaces. Can you talk about how you got to 22 board spaces across 4 factions and 3 other symbols in the first place? (Note: Paul explained the decision to replace existing board spaces in this design diary.)</p>
      <p>4 of the icons and 8 of the spaces came naturally due to the four main factions and wanting two spaces per faction.</p>
      <p>The cities and desert spaces on Arrakis came pretty naturally, too. Arrakeen, Carthag, and Sietch Tabr and the three harvesting board spaces were there since the earliest version of the board (even if the mechanics were slightly different).</p>
      <p>I wanted CHOAM and the Landsraad to be represented in the game, as one of our differentiators was that our game was not just about the conflict on Arrakis but the scheming across the Imperium at large. It made sense to me that the same icon that could harvest could also go to CHOAM. As a side note, one of the early versions of the CHOAM area of the board included a second way to "hire" a Heighliner with a lot of Solari, but ultimately it morphed into a simple two-space section of the board focused on trade, which was resonant with the idea of the mega corporation.</p>
      <p>That left the Landsraad which also needed to be represented, and it felt natural for that section of the board to require a completely distinct icon, which brought the amount of icons to 7. The number of spaces in the Landsraad was somewhat in flux during the design stages, and the 22 total spaces ended up feeling right across multiple playtests of multiple player counts.</p>
      <p>Q: Rise of Ix introduces a high proportion of “wild” influence gain, for example on the shipping track. What’s the thinking behind this? Did you want to make it easier for people to ignore certain factions’ board spaces? Did you want to make it easier for people to contest alliances?</p>
      <p>All these things happened naturally as part of the process of trying to create cool stuff in the expansion rather than having specific goals for player tools. Though I did realize that providing wildcard influence is good gameplay because it gave players agency and allows those things you mention. The shipping track had a wildcard influence as a natural part of making its use feel appealing. There were of course many iterations of the shipping track during the design and development stages but being able to gain an influence with your choice of faction was there the whole time, while other rewards (such as Intrigue cards) came in and out.</p>
      <p>The wildcard influence in the Rise of Ix card file also came about naturally, rather than from a specific intent. I wanted the cards to emphasize the Bene Gesserit ability to manipulate things, so they received a couple of cards (In the Shadows, Web of Power) that were essentially wildcard influence gain. And yes, I consciously wanted players who got those cards to have a little more "juice in the tank" to acquire and chase alliances -- more relevant for In the Shadows than Web of Power, actually. Finally, Negotiated Withdrawal was just one of those "cool designs" that felt like a fun mechanic and good story at the same time. I wanted a step up from the retreat cards in the core game, by providing a retreat-for-benefit mechanic in Rise of Ix. And that's something I want to continue exploring, because feinting is great gameplay and very fun.</p>
      <p>Q: How did you think about balancing 3-player and 4-player games while keeping rules differences to a minimum? Did you consider varying the number of board spaces at different player counts? What about conflict rewards?</p>
      <p>It's been a while, but I recall that the first playtests of the game were 3-player tests, probably due to not wanting to pull three other designers away from their primary tasks to help out with a pretty raw game. I do remember that when we set up the first 4-player playtest, I expected things to go wrong and expected to have to make some modifications to the game for four players. I was pleasantly surprised that the worker placement tension didn't feel terribly different from 3-player games. Sure, the board did become more densely packed with agents, and that did affect gameplay somewhat (e.g. the mentat can get a little less valuable in 4-player games), but all-in-all, it didn't feel broken or in need of fixing. Apart from a couple things.</p>
      <p>The biggest of those things was that 4-player games initially felt too long, especially when four new players were playing. Because the durations were in part because of the same amount of conflict points being distributed to four players instead of three, we decided to reduce the number of points needed to end a four player game from 10 to 9.</p>
      <p>The other thing that needed to be addressed had already been by thinking through the rules for Conflict rewards. As I said, the first playtests were with three players. I had already determined that Conflict cards would have three rewards on them, and that the third player would receive no rewards, and the fact that ties would "bump" players down to the next reward tier. And all along, had been thinking that in 4-player games, there would be three rewards handed out and only the fourth place would receive nothing.</p>
      <p>Q: Dune: Imperium seems to have done really well - it’s in the BGG top 20, and received several awards, including a Golden Geek, and Tabletop Game of the Year Award from SXSW. There’s a 100+ person tournament being run on Tabletop Simulator. Fans love discussing the game - despite releasing in 2020, it’s still in BGG’s Hotness. Have any aspects of the game’s reception surprised you?</p>
      <p>I really didn't have specific expectations or goals other than doing the best I could with the design. As I explained earlier, I was willing to scrap my first design because I didn't think it was good enough. And my boss, Scott Martins, who is the game's Executive Producer, backed me up and encouraged me to take more time to "make it great." He and I are both long-time Dune fans, so we wanted to make a game that would make fans, Legendary, and the Herberts proud. And I know your interview is focused on game design, but the project was very much a team effort. Everyone on our team - our producers, artists, and developers worked really hard to do the same.</p>
      <p>Q: What's next for Dune: Imperium?</p>
      <p>We do have plans to keep supporting the game with more content and we're excited and looking forward to receiving more inspiration from Dune: Part II.</p>
      <p>Thank you! I really appreciate you taking the time for this, and I am looking forward to whatever you put out next!</p>
