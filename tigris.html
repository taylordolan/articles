    <article>
      <p>Hello everyone, I’m Mark and I had the pleasure of MC’ing a discussion
      recently between two excellent Tigris & Euphrates (T&E) players. Lucas and
      Martin have played hundreds of times, dating back to when Board Game Geek
      itself hosted asynchronous games of T&E.</p>
      <p>And me? I’m decent. But that also allowed me to ask questions about
      deeper topics that I knew existed in the game’s strategy, but for which I
      didn’t have perfect answers.</p>
      <p>Reference image below for grid numbering that we reference in the
      article:</p>
      <p>The Opening</p>
      <p>Mark: Let’s start at the beginning: The Opening. I see a lot of similar
      opening moves in T&E. The black and green leaders tend to come out
      immediately, and there are a couple spots that tend to be most popular,
      including around the N5 tile. Can you briefly talk about the justification
      for opening with these leaders, and whether or not it's necessary to get
      off on the right foot, so to speak. When would you want to ignore this
      opening strategy? Are there alternatives you're a fan of?</p>
      <p>Martin: Yes, the early game is driven by treasure and Trader/King is
      the best combination to be able to aim towards a quick treasure while
      scoring in any colour. I hate starting in a corner where I'm out of the
      action, so the best places to drop them are F3, I7 or N5. N5 is nice
      because no one else can add a leader but I don't like to go there unless I
      have at least a couple of blue tiles in my starting hand. I7 also gives
      close access to two different treasures with only a single blue.</p>
      <p>Things can be trickier for the player last in turn order (in a 4p game)
      but depending on their hand there are some nice options. With 3+ red I'd
      consider an immediate Trader revolt, or with 3+ black or green I might
      place close to someone else hoping to win an early war when they expand
      for treasure. Another option is to drop your blue leader on to one of the
      kingdoms that needs to cross water to gain treasure. Either they give you
      a blue point or you stifle their expansion.</p>
      <p>Personally I hate to play red tiles to the board to build up a
      defensive 'matrix' - I'd much rather have them in my hand to use for
      either attack or defence when it arises. But I think Lucas feels
      differently about that…</p>
      <p>Lucas: Exactly! Making those red defensive matrices is something I
      started doing very early in my games. Other things changed a lot for me
      over the years, though - for example, in my early plays I loved to start
      at F10, because it meant being "safe" and being able to get the treasures
      at B8 and K11. Then, just like Martin, I found out that being out of the
      action is actually quite boring (and commonly less efficient), so I
      usually start in one of the two more central temples.</p>
      <p>I usually go to the "water temple" only when other players have taken
      the other positions, perhaps because I enjoy making those red defense
      matrices and starting there means one of the leaders can only be next to
      at most two temples.</p>
      <p>And, of course, things can be different depending on my hand - if I
      have a bunch of tiles that would allow me to win an external conflict I
      may start closer to the target.</p>
      <p>Mark: Interesting to hear an endorsement of the centralized red
      defense! I stumbled onto it at one point and had great fun, but I wasn't
      sure if it was strategically sound. It seems like it’s not universally
      supported, though.</p>
      <p>Martin: Yeah, there are a couple of reasons I don't like the "red
      matrix" - one I already mentioned is that the red tiles are more flexible
      in my hand than on the board; the other is that it entrenches my leaders
      when I prefer to be more opportunistic and nimble. I also often see
      players place a second red next to one of their leaders and create a
      second "double red" spot which they leave unoccupied. If they make that
      mistake I'm very happy to drop one of my leaders in there and take the
      extra support!</p>
      <p>Mark: Ok, so are there openings to avoid that might look appealing on
      the surface? Or is it all dependent on tile draw at the start? I was fond
      of placing leaders at C2 and F2, for example (Green & Black works here, or
      Green & Blue), then linking them on my next turn for a quick treasure.</p>
      <p>But eventually I found that others would come join me before that 2nd
      turn, complicating the connection and inviting an external conflict before
      I was ready for it. Or placing a Blue leader when I had Black, giving them
      a blue point if I were to connect. So it was only good if no one did that.
      I'm uncertain if I was hamstringing myself or taking a calculated
      risk.</p>
      <p>Martin: I think of the opening game (up to the first war or monument)
      in terms of tempo. If you place a new leader on the board or score a point
      from a tile every action, you're "on tempo". Connecting a treasure gains
      you a tempo, as does bringing a leader on via a revolt (because you get an
      extra red point). The reason I don't like the C2 / F2 type opening is that
      you lose a tempo from the tile that has to be used to unify the kingdoms
      and not score a point.</p>
      <p>Lucas: I completely agree with Martin about that possible start, and
      I'd add that I don't like to start in any of the four corners in general,
      not only because it delays the moment I get to the action, but also
      because those treasuries will always be taken once there's a connection,
      leaving them vulnerable to catastrophe tiles.</p>
      <p>Red Tiles</p>
      <p>Mark: So speaking of Red Tiles, a common refrain for those who don't
      care for T&E is that it comes down to how many red tiles you draw. And if
      you don't draw enough, your chances are sunk. Or so the complaint goes.
      What's your response to that criticism? And how do you go about handling a
      game where you draw less than your fair share of red tiles?</p>
      <p>Martin: My main response is that if you think you didn't draw enough
      red tiles, you probably didn't draw enough tiles in total. I'd guess the
      total number of tiles drawn during a game is a pretty good predictor of
      who will win. By the midgame, I'm a bit disappointed if I take a turn
      where I just place a couple of tiles for points and draw two new ones. If
      I do have to, I want it to be setting up for a future war when I can use
      more tiles. T&E is as much a hand management game as a spatial positioning
      one and I'm always trying to shape my hand for strength in one colour that
      I can deploy all at once and then get a fresh hand.</p>
      <p>But if you do draw lots of tiles and still don't see your fair share of
      reds, there are several tools at your disposal. If you're weak in red, you
      must be strong in other colours so you'll have plenty of points in
      green/blue/black from wars or monuments. You can make one half of those
      monuments red and score red points that way. You can look for an
      opportunity to evict an opponent's Priest with a catastrophe and jump into
      a kingdom that's well stocked with red to win a war with. Or you can win a
      war in another colour, removing an opponent leader that's in a spot with
      2-3 red support and then place your Priest into that vacant spot for a
      revolt. It's a very rare game where I feel hamstrung by my tile draw.</p>
      <p>Lucas: My best response for that probably won't mean a lot for those
      who were not here in the old times when it was possible to play T&E at
      BGG, but I have vivid memories of a game on which I was up against some
      players that had a crazily good winning rate, I was the fourth player, and
      I had to face a serious drought of red tiles for a big, big part of the
      game - and I still won. Which was possible because I managed to solve
      external conflicts in the right order.</p>
      <p>Red tiles will help you in internal conflicts of course, but it is in
      external conflicts that the big points are won. And that is where the
      amazing comeback opportunities arise - by shattering kingdoms so that you
      can win conflicts that seemed to be very unlikely to be won, but suddenly
      do because of how you divide kingdoms in your favor.</p>
      <p>Turn Order</p>
      <p>Mark: The other occasional strategic complaint involves Turn Order.
      Thoughts there?</p>
      <p>Lucas: I do believe the turn-order advantage is relevant - with games
      sometimes being decided on a single point, having the last chance to play
      tiles surely make a difference, and so having one less turn than the other
      players can be an issue. It's not something completely crippling, and I
      won a few games as Goat back when that was the 4th player in the
      BoardGameGeek implementation, but yeah, we cannot deny it is indeed a
      thing. Not something that bothers me enough in order to think of house
      rules, though.</p>
      <p>Martin: A lot of gamers seem to be obsessed with balance, while missing
      that differences in skill between the players almost certainly drown out
      any small effect of starting position. Offering to go last can be a good
      handicap if you're the best player in your group.</p>
      <p>Middle Game</p>
      <p>Mark: Shifting a bit, let’s discuss the Middle Game. This will likely
      be the broadest topic, but that's a bit deliberate, because I want to
      allow for sub-topics to emerge organically.</p>
      <p>Martin defined the early game a moment ago as everything up to the
      first monument or war. It seems like a good transition point to me. The
      middle game - to me - is the most lacking in obvious takeaways, because so
      much of it seems dependent on tactical opportunities, which will vary
      wildly. But are there principles you keep in mind during, say, the middle
      50% of the game that have aided you? If so, what are they?</p>
      <p>Martin: Yeah, the early game is something like the first three turns,
      by which time 3 or 4 kingdoms will probably have spanned two treasures and
      in so doing got close enough to each other for war to be in reach. The
      midgame for me (I agree with your middle 50%) is characterised by taking
      the opportunities that present themselves to score big points while not
      worrying too much about the balance of your colours. The endgame is where
      you need to finesse that to maximise your final total.</p>
      <p>So what are those opportunities to score more than the default one
      point per action for placing a tile? Wars and monuments. Let's come back
      to monuments later, as you can play a satisfying T&E game without one ever
      appearing, which certainly isn't the case for wars! I mentioned earlier
      that I try to shape my hand to be strong in one colour at a time (3+
      tiles) and then either attack or 'bait' someone into attacking me in my
      strong colour.</p>
      <p>Defenders get the advantage of winning ties and also starting with an
      extra tile in hand (because the attacker has to play one to join the
      kingdoms). But attacking comes with a huge advantage too, which Lucas
      already mentioned - getting to control the sequencing of the colours.
      Visualising how a multi-step war will play out on the board is one of the
      key skills in Tigris, and also what can make it opaque for new players.
      Knizia's decision to strip this aspect of the game out completely in
      Yellow & Yangtze certainly made it more approachable but, for me, less
      interesting.</p>
      <p>When I trigger a big war, I usually don't expect all the colours to end
      up fighting, and I certainly don't want to start a big fight between two
      opponents which is guaranteed to result in one or the other of them
      winning a lot of points. The sequencing is important because it allows you
      to use one colour to cut off support tiles in another, and to make the war
      end when you want it to. But you should always think through the knock-on
      effects of an unexpected reversal of fortune in one of the early colours!
      For the colours I'm hoping to win with, I like to go in with at least +3
      support factoring in the tiles on the board and in my hand; +2 is risky
      and +1 is desperate.</p>
      <p>War becomes almost inevitable when two kingdoms are separated by only
      one tile. That's because the initiator gets a 'spare' action which they
      can either use beforehand to prepare for the war (by swapping tiles or
      using a catastrophe) or afterwards to exploit the new landscape (for
      example dropping a leader into a well-supported spot that is now vacant).
      So be very careful before you create such a situation for someone else to
      exploit.</p>
      <p>Lucas: I agree with most points, and I would add that one of the things
      I like most about T&E is that it is so situational that things people
      usually think about games involving conflict ("ganging up against
      someone", for example), don't quite work in T&E, because the game is not
      about targeting a player, but on trying to trigger the wars that will
      benefit you the most irrespective of the player(s). So yeah, in the
      midgame what I usually do is try to pick wars where I feel I have a good
      chance to win if I order it correctly, which many times involves doing it
      in a way where I avoid deciding one or more colors. Unless of course in
      those cases in which the first blow will actually give me such an
      advantage that I can win on the other colors as well, which is of course a
      delight!</p>
      <p>It is usually at this point that I think about building monuments if I
      feel I can control them for a few turns (I very rarely build monuments in
      the early game).</p>
      <p>Another thing to do in the mid game is going for those kingdoms hanging
      by a thread - i.e., those (usually by newbies) on which they try to get as
      many treasures as possible in the early rounds by placing single-tile
      lines that can be easily destroyed by catastrophe tiles or a war.</p>
      <p>Mark: Semi-directed opportunism is what I'm hearing here holistically.
      Personally, I've come to respect that defenders win ties, and will use
      that to goad others into starting conflicts with me (by inching one tile
      away) when I look weaker than I really am. Some will wait until they can
      bet the farm with nearly a full hand of tiles, but I win a lot of the
      rest. A lot of aggression in the game starts out looking like defensive
      play, and only turns to bullying once you've amassed a kingdom with a
      strong presence in one or more tile colors.</p>
      <p>I'll also agree with Lucas that the game can feel capricious, but
      rarely personal. We'll have table talk of "we need to stop {Player X},"
      but that rarely manifests as specifically directed attacks. Unless, of
      course, that's what's best for you on a turn as well.</p>
      <p>Martin: Yes, the 'goad' (or 'bait' as I called it earlier) is fun. And
      if you're playing with opponents who are familiar with that tactic, you
      can even bluff a bait when you don't have the tiles and hope they don't
      call you! Also agree with both of you about targeted attacks. In T&E, war
      is mainly about what you gain from it, not who you beat, and there's no
      real way to 'gang up' on someone.</p>
      <p>Catastrophe Tiles & Tile Swaps</p>
      <p>Mark: Ok, from a broad topic to a couple narrower ones: Catastrophe
      Tiles and Tile Swaps. I group these together since they seem a bit
      smaller. I'm not sure I've ever tile-swapped outside of the lone game I
      played on BGA (Board Game Arena) where we had open scoring, so I could be
      sure I was racing toward a win near the end with tile swaps. But I feel
      like I'm probably missing some tactical opportunities. When do you use
      this action, and for what purpose(s)? Or do you at all?</p>
      <p>Similarly, is there advice for catastrophe tiles beyond using them when
      they can help you take over a kingdom that turn, either violently with
      your next action or "peacefully" by jettisoning an opponent leader via the
      catastrophe? Or is there more nuance to it?</p>
      <p>Martin: The tile-swap is definitely the weakest action, but there are a
      few circumstances when I'll use them and it sounds like I do it more often
      than you Mark!</p>
      <p>The main one is when there's a crucial war I can initiate with a single
      tile but I don't quite have the right tiles in hand and want to improve my
      chances. Similarly, I might need a red or two more to feel confident of a
      revolt, probably one that also gets me into a monument. And sometimes I'll
      just have a handful of a colour I don't need any more points in. I'd
      always prefer to find a way to dump these into a war but if I don't have
      that opportunity I might have to trade them.</p>
      <p>Finally there's the endgame trigger of exhausting the tile bag. If
      you're pretty confident you're in the lead and really don't want the next
      player getting another turn, you can do one or even two tile swaps to end
      the game. There's some rules ambiguity between editions on whether you
      score monument points at the end of your turn if you exhaust the tiles
      during one of your actions. I quite like the rule that you don't score
      them, because the double-swap tactic always felt a bit cheesy to me.</p>
      <p>Catastrophes, on the other hand, can be very strong! The most common
      uses are to cut a kingdom in half, allowing you to introduce a leader to
      the 'other half'; to sever leaders from their supporting tiles before
      starting a war; and to remove the single temple a leader or leaders are
      relying on, removing them from the board entirely. Since it's a turn on
      which you don't score points directly, you must use them wisely, and I
      feel quite vulnerable once I've spent both of mine.</p>
      <p>Lucas: Swapping tiles is something I use very, very rarely, and I
      suspect I should do it more often than I do to play better. Most of the
      time it is in online games with open scoring on which I'm ahead and can
      finish the game immediately or after one turn, but I have the bad habit of
      getting stuck with very bad hands because I feel swapping tiles will bring
      me closer to the end while I'm not doing well.</p>
      <p>As for catastrophes, I use them quite often. Most obvious application
      is what Martin described (great on those early lurkers that extend their
      kingdoms like octopuses to catch as many treasures as possible), but also
      on temples next to leaders to have better chances in internal conflicts.
      I've seen people using "preemptive catastrophes" to delay possible wars,
      but that seems a waste to me.</p>
      <p>Player Count Considerations</p>
      <p>Mark: I want to touch briefly on Player Count Considerations. Many
      prefer the game at 4P, but here the focus is on how it changes the
      strategy. What changes at 2P and 3P compared to 4P? I'll admit to never
      having played at 2P, so I can't comment there. Generally in 3P games with
      some form of combat, there are kingmaking issues if two players focus too
      much on each other, so that the players have to be more explicitly aware
      of this and account for it during play. But wars are how you score a lot
      of points in T&E, so the most ignored player might actually be worse off
      on average? I'm speculating a bit, but would love to hear your thoughts on
      either count.</p>
      <p>Martin: For me, it's definitely best with 4p, but that's because I'm a
      very aggressive player as my responses so far have demonstrated! In T&E if
      you're staying away from wars, you need monuments to make up the points
      but I hate it when players get the opportunity to successfully turtle so I
      prefer the 'no hiding place' feel of a full table. I have to say that I
      don't really understand the people who love it with 2p. I played that way
      a couple of times and it just didn't feel like the same game to me, even
      with a variant to make the board smaller.</p>
      <p>Lucas: Yeah, Martin probably remembers that I was among those (rare?)
      ones who preferred to play at 3p. The reason for that being that, with the
      same amount of tiles but less players, it made possible more long-term
      strategies. While the thing you described (two people fighting and the
      third one being on their own) does happen, I think it doesn't necessarily
      mean the "peaceful" one will win, at least among good players, because, as
      Martin said, that would probably mean needing monuments, and good players
      will never let that happen with impunity.</p>
      <p>As opposed to Martin I did play it many times with two (most of them on
      the old BGG implementation), but just like him I don't quite understand
      those who prefer it at 2. As I said before, one of the things I like the
      most in T&E is exactly the fact that you are reacting to the opportunities
      appearing on the board from the other players. With only two players, the
      only thing you actually choose is the conflict order when the two kingdoms
      finally collide (and I say "two" because there is really no incentive to
      build separate kingdoms). Not only that, but depending on the outcome of
      that first conflict (say, one player wins on all colours), the probability
      of a comeback is virtually zero, so it doesn't really make any sense to go
      on. I've had comeback wins when I got trounced in an early war, but doing
      that with two players is almost impossible.</p>
      <p>Mark: Having not played at 2P, I always suspected some considerations
      would change drastically, but that definitely puts in perspective why that
      is.</p>
      <p>Monuments</p>
      <p>Mark: Alright, Monuments. Where, when, why? The unicorn situation of
      completely defending one for a lengthy period of time seems naive to me.
      Once I think I held one for numerous turns in the corner, having walled
      off the only red tile access point, requiring players to build toward it
      more slowly for an external conflict (or giving me a red point in order to
      create an access point for themselves). But otherwise they seem like
      lightning rods for signaling the more brutal middle phase of the game. Do
      you want to be the first to build a monument? How long do you expect to
      keep them? When is it worth ignoring them?</p>
      <p>Lucas: Well, I usually avoid early monuments as they are basically
      invitations for conflicts I'll be less prepared for, but sometimes I can
      do it if I have a crazy amount of tiles from the same color or everyone
      else already settled somewhat far. Otherwise I prefer to be the one who
      steals monuments instead of being the one who builds them.</p>
      <p>And yeah, if I get enough points from those colors, I don't worry a lot
      about defending it unless the attacker is someone who obviously needs a
      lot of those colors and could get ahead of me. Conversely, I'll probably
      try harder to go for a monument (even swapping tiles to get more reds) if
      I'm in those terrible situations of being pretty good on three colors but
      terrible on one.</p>
      <p>On occasion I also like to finish monuments from other players so they
      get weaker in that color and I can snatch them with a war afterwards. Even
      more fun if it’s a red monument with leader(s) that have nowhere else to
      hang to and leave the board when the monument is built.</p>
      <p>Martin: Monuments are a typically brilliant piece of Knizia design. Of
      course earning two cubes per turn for no extra work is powerful, but
      that's balanced by two things. One is that the four tiles that formed the
      monument 'disappear,’ making the creator of the monument more vulnerable
      to (and attractive as a target for) war. The other is that in the process
      of creating a monument, you've often already earned several points in one
      of its colours from tile placement, meaning you get diminishing returns
      from holding on to it.</p>
      <p>I'll sometimes throw one up in the early game if I have the tiles. the
      kingdom is at least 3 spaces away from a war starting and it doesn't have
      an obvious vulnerability to revolt or catastrophe. If and when they do get
      built, they tend to drive the midgame in the same way that grabbing
      treasures drives the early game. If I count up the total cubes going out
      in a round from monuments and I'm not getting my fair share of them, I
      need to do something about it quickly, whether that be through revolt, war
      or catastrophe.</p>
      <p>Another situation that Lucas didn't mention is completing a monument
      someone else has started building so that you get to choose the secondary
      colour. For example, if I have my Priest in a kingdom with someone else's
      other three leaders, and there's a 3/4 complete square of blue, I might be
      better off finishing it so that I can make it a blue/red monument instead
      of them making it blue/green or blue/black.</p>
      <p>Monuments can also allow an end-game catch-up in a weak colour, when I
      probably don't really care if I only hold it for a single turn.</p>
      <p>Endgame</p>
      <p>Mark: Which moves us toward the Endgame. We've broken out the game into
      pieces thus far, so I'll want to wrap up with more holistic general
      strategic insights, but to finish out our more granular game-section
      analyses, let's discuss endgame. Is there much beyond "target the color
      you have the least of?" I've anecdotally noticed players becoming less
      war-happy toward the end, preferring to simply lay tiles for individual
      points in their lowest colors for guaranteed points. Perhaps there are
      some opportunities to exploit this fact?</p>
      <p>Additionally, to what extent do you pay attention to what people have
      accumulated throughout the game? I suppose all hidden point totals are
      technically trackable, but this seems against the spirit of the design to
      me. But approximate tracking may also produce actionable insights for
      those final few turns.</p>
      <p>Martin: There are two ways the game can end - in my experience
      exhausting the tile bag is a lot more common, but the '2 treasures' ending
      condition can be a great surprise move when you think you're in the lead,
      even if you give the treasure to another player.</p>
      <p>The interesting thing about the tile-draw ending is that it's very
      dependent on how many wars/revolts happen. The game is listed as 90
      minutes and I've heard reports of new players going 2 hours or longer, but
      for me, with an experienced table, it's more like 45-60mins. Playing on
      BGA has allowed me to keep track of how many turns we play and it's
      usually within one or two of 12 turns per player.</p>
      <p>You need to have a sense of when the game is nearing the end and then
      prioritise your weakest colour, particularly if you've let it fall a long
      way behind. That might mean using revolt or catastrophe to get in on the
      right monument, finding a war to fight or building your own last-minute
      monument. I'd actually rather have one colour well behind than two colours
      both behind by a bit less as it's easier to focus on one colour at a time
      than two. Of course, treasure is really helpful here too so if there's a
      late opportunity to snag one, you should go for it.</p>
      <p>In terms of keeping track of the other players, I mostly play with
      hidden scoring but sometimes with open scoring in an asynchronous online
      game. The latter gives a very different feel and for me it makes the
      endgame too cold and calculating. I really enjoy the surprise of the big
      reveal at the end - there was a memorable occasion when all four of us
      thought we'd come last with a score of 3 and I won on the tiebreak! You're
      right that even with hidden scoring, you should be able to get a sense of
      what other players are desperate for and counter it if it doesn't
      interfere with your own plans.</p>
      <p>Lucas: Just like Martin, most of my games end with bag exhaustion, and
      when they don't, it is common that I didn't see it coming!</p>
      <p>I'm unsure about players being less war-happy at the end, I've actually
      seen (and done) many times a desperate last effort in order to get last
      minute points when just laying tiles just won't do the trick.</p>
      <p>I agree about this being a 45-60 minutes game, even when it ends due to
      bag exhaustion.</p>
      <p>I usually don't try to memorize how each other is doing with their
      colors except with very obvious cases (remembering who spent too many
      turns controlling monuments), so unless I'm playing with open scores
      (which I only do online), I focus more on the opportunities to use others
      as a way of maximizing all my points. With open scores, though, things are
      completely different, and although I never tracked that information, I
      suspect such games are those on the shorter side of the number of turns
      Martin mentioned, as someone who's ahead can get rid of 12 tiles in one
      turn. When playing face-to-face, though, I prefer having everything
      hidden, because I also love those surprises (I had one game that was
      decided on the third color).</p>
      <p>Final Thoughts & Unique Tactics</p>
      <p>Mark: Since we've broken things down piece by piece, this is your
      chance to talk about a more holistic approach to the game. Martin's advice
      (mentioned earlier) of being the player who cycles through the most tiles
      has stuck with me, for instance, and when he first mentioned it to me
      several months back, I remember it changing how I thought about the game.
      I'd like to think I've done better since then. But are there high-level
      considerations you keep in mind that help, or general approaches to
      strategy?</p>
      <p>Lastly, are there any tactics we didn't cover? I'd be remiss in not
      mentioning one amusing, hyper-specific one I discovered that Martin was
      actually present for…</p>
      <p>I was flush with two types of points that I wouldn't need for the rest
      of the game, but had run out of tiles of either color to defend myself
      with (attached to a monument), also didn't have red tiles, and both
      leaders were only next to one red tile. So I was about to provide easy
      additional points to someone else in a war. So I nuked both leaders with a
      catastrophe tile, which also made it so one extra tile would be needed to
      connect the monument with anything around it and left nowhere to plop down
      a leader that would be instantly attached to the monument. Was it my best
      option with that action? Likely not. But I didn't have great options
      elsewhere, and it was funny. I went on to win the game, albeit largely
      from early conflict wins, not that particular maneuver.</p>
      <p>This isn't to espouse that as a tactic; it was an incredibly specific
      situation. But rather it's to praise the game for being receptive to such
      oblique ideas that aren't immediately obvious. Creativity is rewarded,
      which I always appreciate.</p>
      <p>Lucas: Well, I guess we pretty much covered most stuff. As for
      non-standard strategies, I guess the one that was most memorable to me was
      causing a war with the first move, knowing I would lose it with a color,
      only to regain control of the remaining kingdom in that color with an
      internal conflict.</p>
      <p>Martin: Yeah, I think we've covered most things I wanted to say.
      'Always Be Cycling' is certainly my #1 tip - when in doubt, do something
      that lets you spend more tiles.</p>
      <p>Throughout these notes I've advocated an aggressive, opportunistic
      approach - not just because I think it's successful, but also because if
      everyone plays that way the game is just more fun! (and quicker)</p>
      <p>I've mentioned the time I won with a score of 3, when everyone else had
      3 too. I also won a game by one point in the fourth colour, which my
      opponent has never forgiven me for. Love both of your stories about
      unexpected moves - another fun one is to go for a revolt where you've got
      2 support to your opponent's 1, get them to spend all their red to beat
      you back, and then just drop straight in again.</p>
      <p>And Mark, you're absolutely right about creativity - that's what makes
      T&E my #1 game and keeps me coming back after 100s of sessions. I love
      that it gives you the opportunity to feel clever when you come up with
      something unexpected, and to appreciate your opponents doing the same to
      you!</p>
      <p>Conclusion</p>
      <p>We hope you enjoyed our discussion as much as we did in putting it
      together. Obviously we didn’t touch on things like the “Advanced” board or
      expansions, but hopefully this is a good primer for the game’s strategy
      and tactics, and helps you in your future games!</article></p>
