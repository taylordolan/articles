      <h2>Prologue: To Weep</h2>
      <p>Plot Summary</p>
      <p>Six years ago</p>
      <p>Eshonai arrives at the docks of Kholinar and marvels at its beauty and size. She talks to Gitgeth about the Parshman slaves, whom he calls "rhythmless ones." They are only capable of trying to help and cannot even comprehend the invitation to join the celebration. Eshonai wanders off toward the palace and begins exploring. She peeks into a doorway and sees King Gavilar. Amaram comes out and says that the king would like to speak to her. Gavilar dismisses the others in the room and he invites her to sit down. He shows her a fabrial and explains that they work by trapping spren in a gemheart. She is awed that the humans have made devices that mimic how they apply the forms. He believes that the world is stuck in a rut and needs a major conflict to progress. Eshonai is horrified that Gavilar wants to bring back the gods that their people abandoned long ago. He then gives her a dark yet glowing sphere, which he claims to hold a god, and tells her to give a message to the Council of Five, to remember what they once were and "wake up." Eshonai runs from the room.</p>
      <p>Eshonai is at the evening celebration, beating a drum, trying to lose herself in the rhythm. She has told the Five that Gavilar wants to bring back their gods, and that he has the knowledge to do it. Klade claims to have heard a voice leading him to an assassin, and the Five have agreed to have him kill the king. Eshonai weeps as she leaves the celebration.</p>
      <h2>Part 1: United</h2>
      <p>Plot Summary</p>
      <p>Six days after arriving in Urithiru, Dalinar Kholin revisits the very first vision he experienced. Having become a Knight Radiant by bonding the Stormfather himself, he can enter any of the visions at will and has enough control to not need to be tied down. He is on a cliff with the Almighty, viewing the ruins of Kholinar below. He asks him to transport him down to the rubble. He sees gouges on the stones as if made from claws. He concludes that Kholinar will not fall to the Everstorm, but to something worse that will come after. The Stormfather agrees. Dalinar is frustrated that the monarchs of the world will not unite with him despite the threat. A final wave of destruction closes the vision, and Dalinar insists on staying to watch. He sees a golden light and a dark figure with nine shadows. Stormfather identifies the shadows as the Unmade, the spren of Odium. He comes out of the vision with Navani Kholin standing nearby. He knows he must unite the world before their enemy destroys it. Navani pledges to help despite their current situation, which is already desperate. A messenger comes and reports that Torol Sadeas had been murdered.</p>
      <h2>Chapter 2: One Problem Solved</h2>
      <p>Plot Summary</p>
      <p>Adolin</p>
      <p>Adolin supervises the influx of people and supplies into Urithiru. He's glad for the distraction; he finds it hard to believe that he has actually murdered Sadeas. A messenger comes to report that something has been discovered on the third floor. Adolin knows what it is.</p>
      <p>Dalinar</p>
      <p>Dalinar rushes to the scene to prevent a fight between Sadeas's officers and the men of Bridge Four, whom they accuse of murdering their highprince. Dalinar examines the body and notes that the blood is dried, so the murder took place some time ago. The soldiers claim that they have been looking for Sadeas and kept getting lost in the confusing corridors.</p>
      <p>Dalinar's sons and some scribes arrive at the scene. His officer corps is severely depleted, so other highprinces are there as well, including Turinad Sebarial and his mistress, Palona. She's the first to voice the opinion that Sadeas's death was actually beneficial since he was causing so much trouble. Dalinar leads the group outside and warns them of worse things to come and that they must lead the world against them. His ultimate goal is to unite the entire continent, something never done before. He appoints the highprinces that follow him to various positions in the kingdom. He orders Shallan and Renarin Kholin to practice their powers so they can lead the other Knights that will eventually come to them.</p>
      <h2>Chapter 3: Momentum</h2>
      <p>Plot Summary</p>
      <p>Thirty-four years ago</p>
      <p>Dalinar marches toward the enemy army through a burning field. He emerges from the smoke with his elite guard and ferociously attacks, causing some of the enemy to flee in terror. He drives through the spearmen and laughs as he kills. He feels invigorated but does not yet feel the Thrill, so he seeks out a greater challenge. He sees a brightlord on a horse surrounded by an honor guard and attacks. He makes his way through and orders Jenin to shoot the horse. As Dalinar engages the crown prince, a strap on his shield breaks. His enemy gains the advantage and is about to finish him off, but the Thrill comes, giving him more strength and dexterity. He stabs his foe in the chest. Nearly dead, the man asks Dalinar why he had come for them. He doesn't know; he just goes where his brother Gavilar Kholin sends him in order to consolidate his reign. As he orders his men to take hostages in the village, an arrow slams into his shoulder. They see the assassin on a ridge above the town and ride up on horses, capturing him. Dalinar is amazed at his skill and recruits him into his own army by promising not to pillage the town. They ride back to the town, where the local highprince's and his officers' heads are displayed on spears as a result of Sadeas' executions. Sadeas is disappointed that he can't loot the town.</p>
      <h2>Chapter 4: Oaths</h2>
      <p>Plot Summary</p>
      <p>The Everstorm returns two days after Sadeas is found dead. Dalinar learns from the Stormfather that this is a new phenomenon. He gazes into the storm and sees a vision of destruction. The Stormfather confirms that the enemy is with the storm and is watching him. Navani is there and touches his face with her bare safehand. They kiss, but Dalinar won't go further -- he insists on some sort of wedding, but none of the ardents will marry them because of the old taboo that they are related. Navani grows concerned that Dalinar thinks she is trying to replace his late wife, and he reveals that he doesn't even remember her because of the Old Magic. He does remember a feeling of hatred and having the Thrill on the day of her death. Dalinar suggests that the Stormfather marry them.</p>
      <p>Dalinar and Navani's family gather on the roof of the tower along with some other officers and brightlords. Navani has managed to find traditional wedding garb. Elhokar Kholin gives only a cool blessing to the marriage, but does stay to watch. The Stormfather arrives and has them swear an oath of loyalty to each other, after which he abruptly leaves. The attendees, even Elhokar, cheerfully congratulate the newlyweds. They all leave except for Kadash, who is displeased with the wedding and Dalinar's assertion that the Almighty is dead, with only a remnant spren remaining. Dalinar suddenly remembers the day when Kadash joined the ardentia after he was so disgusted at what he saw on the battlefield. Kadash warns that the ardentia is angry with Dalinar's blasphemies. Dalinar insists he is telling the truth, at least as he sees it. Kadash reminds Dalinar that he can make mistakes; after all, he was with him on 'that day'.</p>
      <h2>Chapter 5: Hearthstone</h2>
      <p>Plot Summary</p>
      <p>Kaladin walks toward Hearthstone, having run out of Stormlight three days prior. The Everstorm had arrived there earlier that day. He begins to find debris along the way. Syl cheerily chats with Kaladin as he gloomily approaches the town, afraid of what he'll find.</p>
      <p>The light rain of the Weeping has resumed. Kaladin waits until nightfall to enter the town. He doesn't see any signs of life. Syl notes the presence of gloomspren, which are uncommon for some unknown reason. He approaches Roshone's manor and sees light inside. A guard opens the door and orders him inside.</p>

      <h2>Chapter 6: Four Lifetimes</h2>
      <p>Plot Summary</p>
      <p>Kaladin enters and recognizes people from the town, but they don't recognize him, probably due to his ragged appearance. He has gone several days without shaving and his worn uniform appears as if it is a size too small. He starts to look for his parents, but the guard tries to order him to see Roshone. Kaladin shoves him away and gives him his best sergeant's glare, then continues his search of the manor. He hears the moans of wounded and follows the sound, hoping that his parents would be attending them. Lirin is indeed there working on someone, and it takes a moment for him to recognize his son. Lirin calls Hesina in, but before Kaladin can truly reunite, he confesses that he failed and could not prevent the death of Tien. His parents tell Kaladin that they were informed that Kaladin was dead too. They have a tearful reunion, his parents with joy, Kaladin for his grief over Tien.</p>
      <p>Kaladin sips some soup while Syl stares at Hesina, perplexed about something. The guard insists that Kaladin be taken into custody because he is branded as a deserter, but Lirin threatens to quit as the town's surgeon. Hesina explains to Kaladin that Roshone has softened, presumably from guilt. Syl tells Kaladin that she knew his family, even before she met him, because everyone is connected. She mentions another voice, "Pure, with a song like tapped crystal, distant yet demanding." Roshone appears, older and more feeble, but still with an imperious bearing. After some goading by Roshone, Kaladin punches him in the face, saying "that was for my friend Moash."</p>
      <h2>Chapter 7: A Watcher at the Rim</h2>
      <p>Plot Summary</p>
      <p>Roshone orders the guards to attack Kaladin, but they note his obvious ability and hesitate. Kaladin regrets his juvenile action and apologizes, telling the guards to stand down. He then orders them into the library for a meeting, but Roshone asks why he should take orders from him. Kaladin summons his Shardblade, allowing his eyes to turn blue.</p>
      <p>In the library, Kaladin finds out that the Parshmen transformed and then just left town. Kaladin wants to figure out where they went, so he asks for maps and a spanreed to communicate with Dalinar, giving Roshone several spheres for the "rental" of some horses since he's out of Stormlight. The soldiers go to the lady of the house (Laral) to ask for the maps. Kaladin warns Syl that he might need her again as a weapon, and she reassures him that it doesn't bother her. All of his weapons were "people" anyway. Kaladin brandishes his sword again for Roshone to emphasize that he's in charge. Despite Roshone's faults, he needs to help the people of Hearthstone. Roshone just slumps in his chair, but Laral arrives and pledges to lead the people. She looks quite different, more mature and practical. He says he wanted to come back to save her, but she says that she is happy with Roshone and resents Kaladin's judgment of him. She goes to set up the spanreed and wait for a reply, so Kaladin goes back to his parents. He starts helping his father tend the wounded. He is disappointed that Kaladin has become one of "them," a person who tries to solve problems with violence. He does acknowledge that the Voidbringers must be fought, but he wanted his son to be a surgeon, not a killer. Kaladin goes back to the library and notices that the spanreed is glowing with Stormlight; they collected some during the last unexpected highstorm. The spanreed starts writing words from Navani, much to the surprise of Laral. Dalinar asks for a status and Kaladin suggests he go looking for the Voidbringers because they just up and left without attacking. Dalinar agrees and tells him to take the spanreed with him to keep him up to date. He closes the conversation and goes to see his mother. She is holding a baby, Kaladin's new brother, Oroden, which means child of peace. Kaladin holds him and cries. Kaladin asks for any infused spheres and trades them two for one. Kaladin tells Lirin that he wants to take his family away to safety, but his father refuses; he is the town surgeon and is needed there. The others in the house overhear the conversation about the Desolation being here, so Kaladin puts on a display with Stormlight and promises that the Knights Radiant have returned and will not fail them. He flies off to a nearby town to get more infused spheres.</p>
      <h2>Chapter 8: A Powerful Lie</h2>
      <p>Plot Summary</p>
      <p>Shallan tries to draw the towers of Urithiru, but is having trouble comprehending the massive city. Pattern tells her that he understands why she would hate him, but she only hates the sword, which leaves both of them confused. A scout comes and reports that the highprince wants to see her. She marvels at the drawings despite Shallan's frustration with them. As they walk, she notices the notoriety she has as a Radiant. She pretends to be an Elsecaller to hide her ability creating illusions. The scout asks her about her sword but seems disappointed that Shallan doesn't intend to use it. She arrives at a meeting room with Navani and Dalinar and his sons. Dalinar is struggling with uniting the various rulers of the continent. He asks Shallan for information, but she has little knowledge of the political world. Dalinar fetches a cup of wine and passes by Shallan, and she is drawn by him to the map on the wall. She draws her remaining Stormlight and creates a three-dimensional projection of the continent in the room. Dalinar believes that the Stormfather helped create the vision since he sees everything in the highstorm, meaning that their powers have somehow merged to do something new. The projection helps him decide to focus on securing the Oathgates in Azir, Jah Keved, and Thaylenah. Lyn, the scout who fetched Shallan, knocks on the door and reports that another murder has been discovered.</p>
      <h2>Chapter 9: The Threads of a Screw</h2>
      <p>Plot Summary</p>
      <p>The murder victim is Vedekar Perel, a member of Sebarial's army. Shallan can't keep up with the long strides of Dalinar, so she falls back. Adolin joins her, taking her arm. They arrive in a chamber with a depression in the middle of the room. The body lies in the depression. The murder appears to be an exact copy of how Sadeas was killed, including the location of the wound and the positioning of the body. Adolin appears shocked and distracted. Dalinar assigns him to investigate the murder since so many other officers were killed in all the recent fighting. Adolin is taken aback and appears nervous. Shallan wonders at his strange behavior and observes Renarin studying him closely. Pattern starts to hum.</p>
      <h2>Chapter 10: Distractions</h2>
      <p>Plot Summary</p>
      <p>Kaladin</p>
      <p>Kaladin approaches a village called Hornhollow and chats with Syl. She notices that he is rather happy at the moment, having found his mother alive and being buoyed by Stormlight. Syl and Kaladin wonder if she could someday be a mother herself; after all, the Stormfather birthed her. He flies into the center of town and is about to grandly introduce himself, but word has traveled ahead about him, and they offer him infused spheres, hoping for a favorable exchange rate. The townspeople seem eager to see him. The citylord mentions an attack by rogue Parshmen, the first report of an attack so far in Kaladin's reconnaissance trip.</p>
      <p>A nervous ardent explains that the Parshmen attacked the grain storage and ran off when an alarm was sounded. Syl tells him that the ardent is infatuated with him, and teases that she must be desperate, considering how disheveled he looks. He dismisses the idea, saying that she would have to marry another ardent. Syl counters that it isn't marriage she wants from him and offers to teach Kaladin about sex. Then she tries to play matchmaker with him and Shallan. He's interested in her but dismisses the idea because she's engaged to Adolin. He then realizes that Syl will be around when he's having sex. The citylord introduces a scout to Kaladin who had followed the Parshmen. They were heading straight for Kholinar. He flies off in pursuit to the cheers of the villagers.</p>
      <p>Adolin</p>
      <p>Adolin goes to visit Gallant. They mourn the death of Sureblood as Adolin gives him treats. Renarin appears; he has been looking for Adolin. He suggests having Shallan draw Sureblood. He also says that he must give back the Shardblade because it hurts to hold. Renarin reluctantly admits that he has created his own blade now and shows Adolin, who admires it for its beauty. Renarin is not content though; he was starting to fit in with Bridge Four, but now he must pivot to being a Knight Radiant. He's afraid that he will make a mistake trying to use his new power. Adolin clasps his hand to give him confidence, and he feels a wash of Stormlight through his body. He sees a vision of himself, perfected and whole. Renarin is embarrassed and leaves, and Adolin is surprised that his wounded wrist is now healed.</p>

      <h2>Chapter 11: The Rift</h2>
      <p>Plot Summary</p>
      <p>Thirty-three years ago</p>

      <p>Dalinar impatiently awaits for the battle to begin, wearing his new shardplate. Gavilar and Sadeas are with him. Their efforts at quelling the other princedoms have only resulted in most of them uniting against Gavilar's rule. Sadeas discusses a political marriage with Dalinar, but he is not interested. The only woman he loves (Navani) is already married, with a daughter. The fog finally rises from the city, and they discuss the lord of the city, Tanalan, who has a Shardblade, but not plate. Gavilar gallops off and Dalinar eagerly follows, determined to win the blade. They are pelted with arrows, rocks and netting, but they quickly reach the fortifications, wreaking havoc on the defending soldiers. When Dalinar jumps back down to destroy the catapults he misjudges his plate's weight and falls down, bending his hammer's handle. He then vows to never make a greenvine mistake like this again. After getting a new hammer from Sadeas he continues his barrage, causing the soldiers to flee. He glories in his power and the Thrill. The catapults neutralized, the army moves through the city gates. Dalinar looks down at the city and feels that something is wrong. Suddenly, the entire precipice collapses and falls into the Rift. Dalinar crashes through many layers of buildings. His Shardplate is damaged, but he survives, unlike the elites that fell with him. Next comes a hail of arrows at him. He runs across a bridge as two soldiers attempt to collapse it, which would send Dalinar another hundred feet down. He is saved by Teleb, who shoots the soldiers. He meets Tanalan, who questions why he should submit to the "king." Dalinar's reasoning is that the strongest military commander should win the throne, and attacks. He manages to get within the reach of his blade and wounds Tanalan. More archers shoot at Dalinar, but he collapses the platform, mortally wounding the brightlord. When the guards carry him away, Dalinar finds he has more wounds from his duel with Tanalan, but the Thrill pushes him along, driving away pain. He sees Tanalan taken through a secret door in the rock and follows. He finds him lying in his blood, a beautiful woman at his side, crying. Their son, only a small boy, challenges Dalinar with his father's Shardblade.</p>
      <p>Hours later, Dalinar rests with his new Shardblade, Oathbringer, sipping wine to help with the pain and shame he feels. Gavilar sits down beside him and wonders what the consequences of the day will be. The remaining people will rebel because Dalinar had killed their highlord and heir. Dalinar suggests he makes soldiers out of them. Gavilar knows they need to act differently, to have an actual functioning government rather than destroying and pillaging for control. Dalinar leans back to rest and remembers the sound of a brave boy crying.</p>
      <h2>Chapter 12: Negotiations</h2>
      <p>Plot Summary</p>
      <p>Dalinar ponders the ancient Knights Radiant and asks the Stormfather what caused their betrayal. He refuses to answer, as some things are better left forgotten. The emperor of Azir has contacted him by spanreed, and Dalinar invites him to visit Urithiru via the Oathgate. They answer vaguely, so Navani suggests an offer of aid to get them to come. They again demur, slightly changing the subject to talk about the new enemy. The Voidbringers did not attack them either, and they are in negotiations with them, ostensibly in order to stall so they can build up their fortifications. Dalinar urges that they allow him to come there through the portal, but they report that it no longer works. Navani and Teshav believe they are lying. Next, the queen of Thaylenah makes contact. Dalinar uses formal language, but she is more blunt and sarcastic. There, the Voidbringers stole most of their ships, and the city itself is in shambles from the Everstorm. Dalinar informs her that he intends to convene a council of monarchs around the world, but she is skeptical of his intentions and is not interested in attending. Dalinar feels like her responses are a bit out of character, as Thaylens seek political opportunities. He offers troops to help with rebuilding the city, but she is reluctant. He then tells her how to find Radiants among her own people and offers to help train them. She replies that she will consider his offer and signs off. He talks to other lesser monarchs but doesn't make much headway; he needs the endorsement of Azir for other surrounding kingdoms to follow along. Dalinar begins to leave the room and finds Elhokar standing without at the doorway. He suggests that maybe the others won't cooperate because they are afraid he'll usurp their thrones. Then he admits that isn't doing well as king and begins to abdicate the throne to Dalinar. Instead, they agree to let Dalinar be the king of Urithiru and the Shattered Plains, forfeiting his Alethkar lands to his heir. Elhokar wants to restore Kholinar, which is rioting, and Dalinar agrees to send him in with the Windrunner, Kaladin, so they can activate the Oathgate and let in troops from Urithiru. A new message comes in from Taravangian, king of Jah Keved and Kharbranth. He fully agrees with Dalinar's plan and has a Radiant at hand to try their Oathgate.</p>
      <h2>Chapter 13: Chaperone</h2>
      <p>Plot Summary</p>
      <p>Shallan transforms herself into Veil. She practices walking with a more confident gait and talking with a deeper, rougher voice. She looks over her sketches of Veil to try to refine the look. She wants to be able to transform quickly, without needing to review them. Someone knocks at her doorway, so she invites them in, assuming it's Palona. It turns out to be Adolin, who sees her in only her nightgown, safehand exposed! She hurriedly dresses while they flirt through the doorway as he waits outside with food and books. She admits him and begins eating. Adolin realizes that this is her bedroom and wonders if it's proper for them to be alone, so Shallan enlists Pattern as a chaperone to prevent them from doing anything "inappropriate" (which he later realizes is "mating"). Adolin convinces Shallan to try some men's food, and it burns her mouth. He has brought several books to help her with her political knowledge since she was lacking in their last meeting with Dalinar. Adolin expresses his concern with the betrothal: he doesn't want to mess this one up like all his other numerous courtships. Shallan reassures him, and they start to kiss until Pattern starts yelling at them to stop.</p>
      <h2>Chapter 14: Squires Can't Capture</h2>
      <p>Plot Summary</p>
      <p>Kaladin has found some Parshmen and creeps up to the camp, past a single guard, expecting monstrous Voidbringers. Instead, he finds them trying to play cards. Their eyes are not red and they have only limited carapace armor. Some are attempting to light a fire under a tarp. Some eat soggy, raw grain from the stolen sacks. Kaladin realizes that their pathetic state is the humans' fault. Suddenly, one calls the alarm as a yellow ribbon of light streaks by. They grab various primitive weapons but are obviously not trained to use them. Kaladin decides to simply surrender.</p>
      <h2>Chapter 15: Brightness Radiant</h2>
      <p>Plot Summary</p>
      <p>Shallan discusses the murder investigation with Adolin. Adolin says that he thinks there are two culprits since the two victims are totally disconnected. Shallan thinks that he is being foolish and shouldn't focus on one theory too much. They decide that there isn't anything more to get from the reports, so Adolin changes the subject to her Shardblade. He convinces her that even though she's a woman, she needs to learn how to use it, and he can train her. She agrees, and he goes to fetch the Blade guards. Shallan freaks out, as she is still not over the fact that she killed her mother with her Blade. Pattern believes that she hates him and offers to die so another spren can take his place. She creates an alternate identity -- someone confident and poised, like Jasnah. She names her Brightness Radiant. With that persona she is able to overcome the history of the blade. Adolin returns and teaches her the importance of a proper stance and breathing. Shallan dismisses her Blade and sketches the proper stance to help her get it right. They practice some simple strikes together. Shallan sees the passion that Adolin has for swordsmanship and realizes that it parallels her passion for art, feeling a bond with him, even allowing herself to become Shallan occasionally. They practice long into the evening.</p>
      <h2>Chapter 16: Wrapped Three Times</h2>
      <p>Plot Summary</p>
      <p>Dalinar examines the Honorblade that Kaladin obtained from Szeth. He tentatively touches the blade, which feels warm to the touch but doesn't scream. Dalinar probes the Stormfather for information about Honor and Odium and learns that Odium must follow certain rules since he's basically a force of nature. Dalinar asks if Honor's suggestion of asking Odium to provide a champion will work. The Stormfather says that it might work, and if man wins, it will buy them precious time. Dalinar reinserts the blade into the sewer and returns to his rooms, where Bridge Thirteen, his guard for the day, awaits. One member, Rial, strikes up a conversation with Dalinar, hinting that he shouldn't have wandered off alone. He goes down to a level where his soldiers are training and offers to spar with Kelerand, one of the ardent swordmasters. He stiffly refuses (due to Dalinar's heresy), and all the ardents but one leave. While Dalinar waits for a sparring partner, he converses with Zahel, the only ardent to remain. He explains that they are torn between loyalty to their highprince and to God. Dalinar seeks out an opponent himself, too impatient to wait for Kelerand to return, and finds Aratin. They begin to wrestle, and the younger man easily gains the upper hand. Dalinar considers accessing the Thrill and even Stormlight, but eventually gives up when Navani shows up. He drinks some water and chastises himself for pushing the match too far, trying to come to grips with his age. Navani informs him that the Iriali queen is ready to talk now, and he insists on conversing with her there while he spars with the sword. He tosses a sword to Kadash and they spar while he dictates to Navani. They argue about religion. The queen says they are considering making a treaty with the Voidbringers. She also holds a grudge for Dalinar's stolen Shardplate. Kadash urges Dalinar to recant his claim that the Almighty is dead, appealing to tradition. Dalinar counters that just because something is tradition doesn't make it right. Dalinar ends the duel and Navani reports that the queen demands the Shardplate, even though her claim is tenuous because she isn't related to Evi. Dalinar realizes that he can now hear his former wife's name. More memories flood his mind, causing him to collapse.</p>
      <h2>Chapter 17: Trapped in Shadows</h2>
      <p>Plot Summary</p>
      <p>The Parshmen argue about what to do with Kaladin, who is tied up to a tree nearby. Khen wants to kill him, but the others dissuade her. Kaladin dozes for a while until night falls. The Parshman playing cards unties him from the tree, and they start out. Kaladin converses with his captor, who has been joined by his young daughter. He realizes that they are essentially runaway slaves, and points out that he was a slave once too. The Parshman does not identify with him, however, because their minds were taken from them, not just their freedom. They march on, and Kaladin tries to talk to Syl, who is flitting around like a windspren. He thinks that there is trouble with the bond again, but she tells him that she's just pretending because the voidspren might be able to see her. She explains to him that the Parshmen have had their Identity restored by the Everstorm. Kaladin wants to help them, so he starts giving them advice. He cuts his bands with Syl and starts to teach them how to obtain and preserve food. They decide to return his possessions, and he builds a fire for them.</p>
      <h2>Chapter 18: Double Vision</h2>
      <p>Plot Summary</p>
      <p>Shallan becomes Veil. She sneaks out of her room and heads toward the market. On the way, Pattern tells Shallan that he likes Adolin. He doesn't mind that he wields a corpse because that's just how things work in the Physical Realm; you must destroy to survive. She arrives at the market in the Breakaway and just sits around for a while, listening to conversation. She then finds a low-end tavern in which to practice. She ignorantly orders some very strong "wine" and almost throws up. She continues to drink the stuff, and a bouncer nearby starts flirting with her. She becomes intoxicated but manages to ask him where any stabbings have taken place. She tries to leave but collapses on the floor. She uses some Stormlight to ease the pain, and she's suddenly not drunk. She heads out to All's Alley, site of a recent stabbing. She asks for the strongest stuff they have and ends up with some Horneater white. She downs a few drinks, healing herself as she goes. She probes the barkeep about any recent murders, and he directs her to a group of thugs in the corner. She sits down in the seat of a Horneater and starts asking a woman named Betha about the murderer. Ur comes back from the restroom and throws her out of the seat. She comes back and places her safehand on his hand and stabs them both with a knife, getting the seat back from him. Veil threatens to do worse unless she starts getting answers, and idly scrapes the symbol of the Ghostbloods on the table. Intimidated, Betha reveals that a man named Ned had strangled his wife, and then the next night he had come back and killed a barmaid the same exact way, although he vehemently denied the second murder.</p>

      <h2>Chapter 19: The Subtle Art of Diplomacy</h2>
      <p>Plot Summary</p>
      <p>Thirty-one years ago</p>
      <p>Dalinar sits at a feast while Toh talks with Gavilar. He's bored by politics and wishes that instead he could go and eat with his men. Dalinar starts to eat and realizes that he doesn't have his knife with him. He wants to just dig in with his hands, but everyone is using utensils, so he leaves the dining hall in the middle of the highstorm to go find his knife. He finds the bunker where Teleb is and pounds on the door. When no one answers, he summons his Shardblade and cuts his way in. Teleb tells him that he returned his knife, so Dalinar heads back. He dodges a boulder on the way and sees some sort of monster on glowing legs. He forces his way back into the feast hall, and everyone stares at him incredulously. Toh is disturbed and excuses himself. Gavilar is actually glad because Dalinar just demonstrated that he could protect them. Navani walks in, so Dalinar orders more strong wine. She and Ialai join the king, and they discuss Toh and his wife, who is deemed to be dense, but honest. Toh is bargaining with Shardplate that he has stolen from his native land, Rira. They discuss the possibility of Dalinar marrying Evi and gaining the Shardplate. A servant brings Dalinar a knife, but it's too small; Dalinar bends it cutting his steak. He spots Evi across the room and admires her blonde hair. Then he finally spots a good knife: in the hands of an assassin taking Gavilar's plates. Dalinar knocks the man down to the floor and stabs him repeatedly, killing him. Then he washes the blood off the knife with his wine and starts eating with it. He agrees to marry Evi to help forge an alliance. Gavilar is sure they'll accept after seeing Dalinar in action.</p>

Sah complies, but resents that he is being ordered about, that he has to learn things he should already know. He resents the yellow spren as well, who is apparently constantly ordering them about. Kaladin tells him that he doesn't have to fight the humans, but Sah believes that they will try to enslave him again. Syl informs Kaladin that a highstorm is coming soon.

      <p>Shallan wakes up the next morning to the sound of Adolin knocking. Her antics the night before seem like a dream. Adolin finally peeks in and discovers the empty jug of Horneater white, so she confesses that she had been out investigating the murders. Adolin offers an infused ruby mark, and she's able to completely heal, headache and all. He asks for her to visit Ialai with him.</p>
      <p>Shallan goes to Sebarial's sitting room to meet Adolin after getting ready. Sebarial lives in luxury, with cots and a masseuse. He is already formulating a plan to tax the passage through the Oathgates, as that will be a vital source of income to maintain Urithiru. Adolin insists on bringing two of her guards along, not so much for protection, but for prestige. Vathah leads them while Gaz guards their back. Adolin coaches Shallan on keeping her soldiers busy so they will feel needed and important. Shallan compliments him on being like his father, but he seems to resist the praise, hiding something. They arrive at Sadeas's area and are escorted in to see Ialai. Mraize is there, standing beside her.</p>

      <p>Plot Summary</p>
      <p>Mraize is dressed like a common soldier and has a strange-looking chicken on his shoulder. Ialai obliquely accuses Dalinar of murdering Sadeas, but Adolin denies it, claiming that anyone who thought so is an idiot. Ialai orders Mraize to fetch a chair for Adolin. She also dismisses Shallan to go fetch tea. Shallan reluctantly obeys only so she can talk to Mraize. He calls her out for using the Ghostblood symbol the night before, but says that is allowed since she is a member. She demands to know about her brothers, and he assures her that they are safe. However, she does have a debt to him for the broken soulcaster, so he gives her a task: secure Urithiru by getting rid of the "darkness" that is there. In exchange, he hints that he will tell her what happened to Helaran. She brings back some tea for her and Adolin only and goes back to the main room. Ialai suggests to Adolin that he search among his own people for the assassin, since someone might have acted on Dalinar's behalf without a direct order. She then shocks them both by telling them to report their findings to Meridas Amaram. The meeting ends and they leave, wondering why Ialai is trusting Amaram since he's been discredited.</p>

      <p>Dalinar waits at an Oathgate, thinking about his wife. He can only remember what she looks like and how they came to be betrothed. He remembers that her death led him to excessive drinking and visiting the Nightwatcher, but he doesn't remember what he asked for. The Oathgate opens, and Taravangian arrives with his head scribe, Adrotagia. He acts rather dense and needs prompting from her. He introduces Malata, a Dustbringer.</p>
      <p>Taravangian rides up the elevator and continues to act almost childlike. Adrotagia has to answer for him when Dalinar asks about Kharbranth. They arrive at the top level where Navani meets them. While the newcomers are given a brief tour, Dalinar and Navani wonder if Taravangian will be of any use in his condition. More memories return to Dalinar, and Navani is puzzled because she's never known of a case in which the curse goes away. Taravangian asks about the other monarchs and is informed that he is the only one who has come so far. He suggests attacking, to the dismay of Dalinar. That is just the suspicion that he wished the monarchs didn't have, but it was to be expected, given his history. He says he will not attack, but it's obvious that Adrotagia doesn't believe him.</p>

      <p>Plot Summary</p>
      <p>Shallan is exploring Urithiru. She finds a theater and uses her lightweaving to show Pattern a play. The play is of a girl who lives in a village surrounded by a wall. The girl curiously asks the townsfolk why the wall is there. She doesn't receive a satisfying answer, so she decides to climb the wall. Spikes and statues make the climbing easy, even so the climbing takes days. On the other side of the wall she sees stairs and walks down to another village that has Stormlight. She takes the Stormlight and brings it to her village. Pattern is very interested in the play but Shallan runs out of Stormlight before she finishes. She realizes that she created an audience, though the figures are vague. She pulls back in the Stormlight, telling Pattern the rest of the story before she notices that one of the audience wasn't her creation. She chases after it. After entering a room she sees various figures of herself as a child, Veil, etc. The figures fade away, leaving her alone, her quarry lost. She notes several shafts that lead to the market, and sees the black figure, whom she thinks is a spren, climbing through one of them. She runs to the market but doesn't get there in time. Rock is stabbed in the hand by the black figure that she thinks impersonated Veil. She realizes that Rock is similar to the Horneater she stabbed earlier. She turns to leave, and Ishnah, who witnessed her using the Ghostblood's symbol the night before, asks to join her. Shallan rebuffs her.</p>
      <h2>Chapter 26: Blackthorn Unleashed</h2>
      <p>Plot Summary</p>
      <p>Twenty-nine years ago</p>
      <p>Dalinar prepares for battle, in prayer with his betrothed, Evi. She encourages him to not kill in anger, to "be a man and not a beast." He leaves to fight in what should be a decisive battle for the kingdom. Gavilar notes that Sebarial hasn't shown up, ostensibly due to supply line problems, but Dalinar believes he's just waiting to join the winning side. A small number of Ryshadium gallop by, musicspren trailing behind. Gavilar tells Dalinar to kill Kalanor, the Shardbearer highprince, to finally quell all resistance to the kingdom. The battle begins, and Dalinar seeks out a section of Kholin troops doing poorly, then attacks. He gets so enthralled he doesn't realize how many he is killing. Kadash finally snaps him out of it, and Dalinar has realized that he's killed some of his own troops. His slaughter has drawn out Kalanor. Dalinar seeks him out, regretting that he can only kill one man instead of hundreds. He finds Kalanor on a Ryshadium. Dalinar fights him and the two end up on a high ledge. After trading blows, Kalanor stumbles back, losing his blade, holding on for dear life, begging mercy from Dalinar. He runs him through the face with his Shardblade, but feels oddly dissatisfied. The Thrill fills him with strength and arrogance -- all others are weak, and he deserves to rule. He dashes to Gavilar, intending to kill him, but realizes that he is about to murder his brother and stops. He gives up his newly acquired Shardplate and blade to Gavilar for his heir. Dalinar vows to never be king.</p>
      <h2>Chapter 27: Playing Pretend</h2>
      <p>Plot Summary</p>
      <p>Shallan is in a meeting with Dalinar and the highprinces, not really paying attention. She should act as Radiant would, but she draws instead. She shows a picture of the creature she chased to Pattern, and he doesn't know what it is exactly, only that it is of Odium. Next she turns to her sketches of the victims. She realizes that each of the second victims looks like the first ones. Malata wanders over to talk with Shallan. She says she doesn't belong to Taravangian, that Spark suggested they check out Urithiru. Shallan does not see her spren. Malata suggests that the Radiants need not gather, that the Desolation claimed by the Alethis may be made up. She leaves, then Ialai enters, announcing that Amaram is the highprince of the Sadeas princedom. Dalinar accepts him, but Adolin insults him and is dismissed by his father. Shallan follows and tells Adolin that she thinks that Amaram killed her brother. She's shocked when Adolin reveals that Kaladin was the one who killed the Shardbearer on the battlefield that day, saving Amaram. Adolin goes off to tend his horses, but Shallan stays behind and looks through her sketchbook again. She finds strange, violent pictures that she doesn't remember drawing. Unnerved, she goes to find her soldiers to give them something dangerous to do.</p>

      <p>Plot Summary</p>
      <p>Dalinar is frustrated that Azir has refused to open the Oathgate. Azir is planning to destroy their Oathgate. He asks Teshav to contact Queen Fen again. While the spanreed writes back, Dalinar experiments with Adhesion, climbing up to an apparent ventilation shaft on the wall near the ceiling. Queen Fen replies and refuses to enter into a treaty because she thinks that Dalinar, the Blackthorn, is not sincere. Dalinar wanders the halls. After an hour, Lyn finds him and tells him that Bridge Four wants him. They show him Oathbringer. Dalinar picks it up, hearing the scream of the dead spren. He asks the Stormfather if it can be healed, but he knows of no way to do it. He takes it to Ialai and puts it reverently on the floor. He sees Amaram there and reminds him that he will face judgment for killing defenseless men. Amaram calls him a hypocrite, as he has slaughtered thousands with his Shardblade. Dalinar has no response, and seeks solitude in his rooms. Taravangian is there, and they discuss the conundrum of sometimes having to punish the innocent in order to protect society at large. The Stormfather tells Dalinar that he is not a hypocrite, but Dalinar disagrees. He wants to know more about Nohadon, so he asks to see that vision again. The Stormfather offers to show Navani directly, and that gives Dalinar an idea: put Queen Fen into the vision with him.</p>

With Pattern's help, she trails her target to a hidden room with a pit. She sends Pattern to retrieve Adolin for additional protection. While she waits, she turns back into Shallan. Adolin arrives in his Shardplate and the entirety of Bridge Four. They descend into the pit. They find a room covered in murals. The ceiling is a depiction of the ten heralds, and the walls have three figures on them, one of them depicting the Almighty. Adolin opens two locked doors with his Shardblade. Inside they find an old decaying library. Down a third tunnel Renarin sees a large black mass, like glistening tar. He identifies her as Re-Shephir, the Midnight Mother. The Unmade attacks by creating vaguely human figures out of black goo. Adolin and everyone else are forced to retreat. Shallan creates several figures with Lightweaving, and the Unmade shrinks back. Adolin and Bridge Four attack again, Shallan using copies of them to help, but they are again overwhelmed. Shallan touches the mass with her bare safehand.</p>
