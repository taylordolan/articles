      <p>Plot Summary</p>

      <p>Kaladin and the parshmen reach a city. He sees thousands of parshmen, but few are as prepared and well-outfitted as his band. Sah marvels that they have their own city now. Kaladin sees signs of fighting and wonders where the humans are. Syl reports that they are in the parshmen quarters and open pens and warns that another highstorm is coming. A parshmen scribe orders them to send Kaladin to the pens, but Khen reluctantly recommends that he be allowed to fight with them. The scribe refers them to a Fused, a Parshendi-like creature with lots of carapace and red eyes. It heads over and Kaladin decides it's time to go. He grabs a bag of spheres from Khen and flies off, the highstorm rumbling in the distance. He asks Syl for directions to Urithiru, but she doesn't know the way. He heads east and spies the humans in open pens below. He drops down and tells them to take shelter. Two flying Fused suddenly attack. They have similar powers to him, but aren't as experienced and can't fly through a highstorm as well as Kaladin. He pleads with the Stormfather to divert the storm, but he won't stop. He goes back down and desperately tries to save as many people as possible, but it's not enough. He lashes out with Stormlight and creates a barrier made of windspren, diverting the storm. More people make it inside. One of the Fused is back, but Kaladin lets the storm carry him away as he Lashes himself upward. The Fused give chase but cannot keep up. Syl directs him to Urithiru.</p>

Urv wants to see her progress on translating the Dawnchant.

      <p>Plot Summary</p>

      <p>Shallan is still resting from her encounter with Re-Shephir. Her drawing has a more scholarly focus now that Jasnah is back. She's impatient to know how she survived, so she leaves her rooms to find her. She finds out that she's down by the jewel-encrusted pillar, so Shallan descends into the pit, the feeling of wrongness gone. Jasnah speculates that it's an intricate fabrial, and explains to Shallan how they work, trapping a spren and stimulating it to make it work. She tells her to sketch the jewels, and Shallan has a hard time taking orders now, but complies. Jasnah compliments her on her accomplishments while she was away and wants to be filled in about the discovery of Urithiru. When Shallan asks how she survived, she simply answers that she is an Elsecaller. That doesn't mean anything to Shallan, so she explains that she has the ability to go to Shadesmar. Getting back is more difficult, which is why it took so long for her to return. She asks for more sketches of what has happened in her absence and admits that she was wrong about the usefulness of Shallan's drawing skill. Jasnah is frustrated at being so behind current events.</p>

      <p>Chapter 34: Resistance</p>

      <p>Characters

      The Stormfather
      Fen Rnamdi</p>

      <p>Plot Summary</p>

      <p>Dalinar enters the vision. He asks the Stormfather to put Queen Fen in the role of Heb, the father in the house attacked by the Midnight Essence. He comes as one of the Radiants, flying with the aid of a Windrunner. He asks him questions to try to figure out why Shardplate from this time is glowing, but he can't get a straight answer. They arrive at the town, and Dalinar is ordered to help the villagers while the Windrunners engage the creatures. He sneaks to the house and finds Taffa's body. He makes his way back to the town and finds that Queen Fen has organized the townspeople to fight. She is incredulous that a tyrant such as Dalinar has been chosen to lead the Knights Radiant, if their return is even true. Dalinar argues that she has little option but to let him go to Thaylen City; she is more convinced by his passionate plea than his "diplomatic" language over spanreed. Indeed, she didn't even trust it was him. Now that she has talked to him in person, Dalinar believes she will reconsider.</p>

      <p>Sigzil wakes up to the sound of Rock's breakfast bell. He thinks about his life in Azir, studying for the government tests. He washes and shaves, using Stormlight to heal a nick. He heads to the common room and almost runs into Lopen, hanging upside down from the ceiling. He goes to Kaladin's private quarters to discuss matters of business. The battalion lacks officers and scribes and their finances are in shambles. Multiple religions are practiced. Sigzil's Azish training makes him want to bring order to it all. He also suggests recruiting since their numbers are down and members of Bridge Four might go off on their own as Radiants. As they walk down the hall, they see Lyn, and Kaladin asks if she wants to join. At first she is elated -- until he assigns her as a scribe. She declines, but does accept the offer of a formal tryout that Kaladin is setting up. Sigzil brings up many other problems like chain of command and wages, and Kaladin tells him he should have been a scholar. Sigzil admits that he tried but failed the exam; Kaladin tells him it was a stupid exam because they missed out on having him. They arrive at the quartermaster and borrow the royal emerald reserve, freshly Invested so Bridge Four can "practice being Radiant."</p>

      <p>Plot Summary</p>

      <p>Twenty-four years ago</p>

      <p>Dalinar talks to his wife Evi in front of a fire. She is pregnant. Evi delights in the playing flamespren, but to Dalinar, they are fighting. Evi wants Dalinar to enjoy living life instead of living to fight. Dalinar wonders if he can truly change, and Evi encourages him to find the Nightwatcher, the "One," if he believes he cannot do it himself. A messenger from Gavilar arrives summoning Dalinar. He tells Dalinar that Rathalas demands the Shardblade back for the heir of Tanalan. Dalinar had told Gavilar that he "dealt with the heir" (Tanalan's child), but he actually spared the child. The child is now grown and Rathalas is in rebellion. Dalinar is excited at the prospect of killing again, and the emotion shocks him. Evi is pleased to hear that he extended mercy, and Dalinar is proud to be a hero to her. Gavilar plans to use politics to resolve this instead of war so his son, Elhokar, won't have to deal with this in the future. Dalinar knows it won't work.</p>

      <p>Plot Summary</p>

      <p>Rock is cooking stew and surprised at how he finds the barren Shattered Plains beautiful. Kaladin is training crews on how to use Stormlight. He first has them swear the first oath, and Lunamor quietly recites it to himself as he cooks. He instructs Lopen, Sigzil, and Peet to start teaching. Dabbid takes over stirring. Lunamor goes to find Hobber and finds Kaladin kneeling beside him. He tenderly encourages Hobber to try breathing in Stormlight. Rock is skeptical he can do it, but Kaladin insists all of Bridge Four will, and maybe others. He cautions Kaladin that they are going to war and some may die. Several of the bridgemen are glowing; Lopen has stuck his face to the ground. Elhokar appears and asks Kaladin to come with him to Kholinar and reclaim their home. Kaladin agrees and is given twenty days to prepare the rest of the men. Renarin meanwhile comes straight from his daily duty at the Oathgate to be with Bridge Four. Rock invites him over to help cook and notes he can see all spren, but never Renarin's. Renarin wonders if he belongs to Bridge Four since he is not a Windrunner, but Rock insists that he does. He is conflicted over what is expected of him -- to be a warrior, or what he is good at, scholarly work. He feels the odd one out, but Rock points out Rlain; Renarin goes to sit by him. The men come over for a drink break. Skar is struggling at drawing in Stormlight, but he manages to teach Lunamor how to draw some in. Skar, instead of being jealous, is pleased, being a teacher at heart. Rock suddenly notices a large group of spren gathered to watch Bridge Four practicing. Sylphrena says they wouldn't talk to her because she sought out Kaladin and hate to admit they were wrong. Rock makes an offering of Stormlight-infused spheres. The human-sized spren draws it in before flying away. Hobber breathes in a bit of Stormlight and calls the bridgemen over. Kaladin tells them to give him all their spheres so his legs can heal. He tentatively stands up, and Lopen gives him the two-armed Bridge Four salute, which Hobber proudly returns. Rock looks to the west and sees a plume of smoke.</p>

      <p>Kaladin flies off to investigate. Rock and Bridge Four grab their bridge and start marching. With Stormlight, the task is quite easy. They reach the caravan and see a dead Voidbringer, brought down by an Unkalaki arrow. A makeshift fortification of piled up furniture is nearby. A woman peeks out and Rock realizes it's his family.</p>

      <p>Rock introduces his family to his fellow bridgemen. He updates his wife on what happened in his disastrous bid to win Shards from Sadeas. She tells him that something is terribly wrong back at their home. Kaladin promises accommodations for his family. The men of Bridge Four solemnly carry the bridge for the last time. No longer slaves, they will now fly with Stormlight.</p>

      <p>Chapter 38: Broken People</p>

      <p>Characters
      Dalinar Kholin (point of view)
      Stormfather
      Navani Kholin
      Jasnah Kholin</p>

      <p>Plot Summary</p>

      <p>Dalinar enters the vision fighting with a spear among poorly equipped men. He charges forward toward a company of savage men, but his untrained allies fail to support him; his arm is cut off. Dalinar merely wraps it and continues fighting, thinking that it's "cheating" to heal with Stormlight. A Voidbringer joins the enemy. A Radiant (Stoneward) appears and creates handholds down the cliff so they can escape. The Stormfather says that though Dalinar shares one of the two Surges of the Stonewards, it is not the one that he sees. Dalinar realizes that humans were fighting with the Voidbringers.</p>

      <p>The Stormfather then brings in Jasnah and Navani into the vision at Dalinar's request. They see a Radiant using a device to stimulate Regrowth and Navani rushes off to watch. Jasnah marvels that the civilization is more primitive than that of a previous vision. She worries about how Dalinar will react to being accused as a heretic. She tells him not to let others define who he is.</p>

      <p>They decide to split up and see as much of the vision as possible. Navani returns, dictating her observations to Teshav who is in the same room outside the vision. She hasn't figured out how the healing fabrial works. They run up a hill to see thousands of bodies and other terrible signs of the Desolation. Dalinar is startled to find that the boulder at the top of the hill was actually a slain creature made of stone. They continue on past the corpses to a place with nine Honorblades rammed into stone. They recognize the one that killed Gavilar, the Honorblade that Szeth carried.</p>

      <p>The Stormfather explains that the Voidbringers were given power by Odium, and when they were killed, they were simply reborn into the bodies of parshmen. Humans could never defeat them if they kept reincarnating, so Honor created the Oathpact with five men and five women. After each Desolation they would return to Damnation to hold back the spirits of the dead until a Herald, under torture, broke their oath. The Desolations came more often because it would take a shorter time for one to break. In this "last" Desolation, when nine of them survived, they hoped that the only Herald to never break, Talenelat, would be enough. He lasted 4,500 years of torture until finally breaking.</p>

      <p>Dalinar realizes that the "madman" from Kholinar is really Talenelat, though the blade he had when he arrived at the Shattered Plains was not his Honorblade. He asks the Stormfather if the breaking of the Oathpact caused the Recreance, but he refuses to reveal that deeper secret, assuming that it would cause Dalinar to break his oath as well.</p>

      <p>Chapter 39: Notes</p>

      <p>Characters
      Shallan Davar (point of view)
      Dalinar Kholin
      Jasnah Kholin
      Navani Kholin
      Renarin Kholin
      Kaladin
      Pattern</p>

      <p>Plot Summary</p>

      <p>Shallan attends a meeting with Dalinar, Jasnah, Navani, Kaladin, and Renarin in the tower basements. Shallan is again perturbed by Jasnah's treatment of her when the latter announces that Shallan will scribe notes for the meeting. They discuss the new information regarding the sacrifices of the Heralds and their role in keeping the Desolations and Fused at bay in the past. Kaladin and Jasnah swap insults regarding their opposing views on how to deal with the ordinary parshmen; Kaladin seeks to spare the innocent while Jasnah sees them as surplus vessels for the immortal Fused to inhabit. Dalinar agrees to attempt negotiations, much to Jasnah's chagrin. Jasnah shocks them all when she suggests they concentrate on finding the Heralds and killing them in order to reseal the Fused. Since spanreeds have become unreliable, Jasnah convinces Kaladin to at least use his windrunners to monitor the movement of Voidbringer troops.</p>

      <p>Jasnah glances at Shallan's notes and notices a sketch of Kaladin, so she calls for a short break. She confronts Shallan's passive-aggressive rebelliousness (and reminding her she is betrothed to her cousin) and Shallan asserts that her wardship is complete. Jasnah offers Shallan high compliments and respect for what she has accomplished on her own, but states that she will remain her ward until she demonstrates minimum requirements for a scholar. Pattern indicates to Shallan that the room they are in has memories, prompting Shallan to tell Jasnah that there may be something in Shadesmar. Jasnah reviews Shallan's notes and commands her to write them out in long hand before submitting them to her brother and mother. She goes back to her room so she can change to Veil and notices a letter pinned to her coat.</p>

      <p>Chapter 40: Questions, Peeks, and Inferences</p>

      <p>Characters

      Gaz
      Red
      Shob

      Ishnah
      Mraize (mentioned only)</p>

      <p>Plot Summary</p>

      <p>Shallan reads the letter. It tells of two groups "which presaged the return of the Voidbringers." The Sons of Honor, led by Gavilar and Amaram, worked to bring about the Desolations in order to draw out the Heralds and restore power to the Vorin church. The Skybreakers, an order of Radiants whose members had not broken their oaths, led by Nale, hunted down and killed anyone who had, or were about to form a bond to spren, because Nale thought that that would prevent the Voidbringers from coming back. Helaran was recruited by Nale, but was not accepted fully, so he may have taken it upon himself to kill Amaram to prove his worth. Or perhaps there was a potential Radiant in his army; if that was the case, it was not Kaladin, or he would have been killed while a slave. The letter abruptly ends. Shallan destroys the letter and goes out as Veil.</p>

      <p>Veil enters the common room and finds Shallan's soldiers playing a game. She complains about Shallan a bit, then joins the game, betting some spheres. She wins, astounding the others with her skill. They ask Veil if Shallan will give them something else to do and advise her to tell Shallan that they aren't good men. Veil recognizes a laundry girl and grabs her: it's Ishnah. She claims to have been a spy for another Brightlady, so she has useful skills. Veil tells her she can prove herself if she trains her men well. Otherwise, she has to leave her alone. Ishnah agrees.</p>

      <p>Characters
      Teft (point of view)
      Kaladin
      Lunamor</p>

      <p>Plot Summary</p>

      <p>Teft wakes up in an alleyway after a night of indulging in firemoss. He stumbles to a well for water and contemplates suicide. He sees the reflection of a spren in the water and angrily tells it to find someone who cares. He wanders away from the well and realizes it's morning. He can't bring himself to return to the barracks. The spren appears again, but he just turns aside into the firemoss den from the night before, indulging in three more bowls. He no longer uses for euphoria -- just to be able to function. He wakes up with his head on the table in a puddle of drool. Kaladin and Rock have found him. Kaladin asks him where his coat is, and admits that he has sold it.</p>

      <p>They carry him back to the barracks and give him some stew. He apologizes and promises to let them help him. He knows he won't have any moss for a few days and is ashamed that that is his most pressing concern.</p>

      <p>Chapter 42: Consequences</p>

      <p>You must know better than to approach us by relying upon presumption of past relationship.</p>

      <p>Characters
      Dalinar Kholin (point of view)
      Yanagawn
      Lift</p>

      <p>Plot Summary</p>

      <p>Dalinar is in the vision of the Aharietiam with Yanagawn. He has assigned the young emperor as a common soldier, but Dalinar makes sure he doesn't die in the battle. The Radiant arrives and the battle is drawn away from them. Yanagawn walks away from Dalinar and starts chatting with some of the wounded soldiers. Jezerezeh'Elin himself is there, proclaiming the final victory over the Voidbringers. Dalinar approaches Yanagawn and identifies himself, saying that he brought him into the vision, but Yanagawn is skeptical. Dalinar shows him the terrible battlefield and tries to convince him to join Alethkar so they can fight the Voidbringers together. The last time an Alethi united with Azir, the Sunmaker led a reign of terror with arbitrary purges. Dalinar insists that he is different because he is old enough to have seen the consequences of war. Suddenly Lift shows up, and Gawx joyously greets her. She tells him not to trust the Blackthorn, and they vanish. The Stormfather is upset that the Nightwatcher has somehow given her the power to leave the vision.</p>

      Kaladin (mentioned only)</p>

      <p>Plot Summary</p>

      <p>Moash sits by a fire eating some stew that doesn't compare at all to Rock's. Graves and Febrth are arguing about what direction they should be heading. Graves tells Moash to get rid of the patch on his coat, so he cuts it off, but he doesn't throw it away. He wonders what Bridge Four is doing. He imagines Kaladin telling them what he had done. His regret and shame lead to thoughts of suicide. The camp is suddenly attacked by four Fused, and they quickly kill his companions. Moash manages to avoid the initial attack and squares off with a Fused that moves like an Edgedancer. He dismisses his Shardblade and instead fights using his training from Kaladin. He manages to kill one, later revealed to be Leshwi, and faces off with the other three. They are so impressed with him that they give him the chance to join them and live. He summons his Shardblade again and breaks the bond. He is carried off.</p>

      Dalinar Kholin</p>

      <p>Plot Summary</p>

      <p>Veil sits in a tavern with Gaz, Vathah, and Red while Ishnah trains them. She has them close their eyes and describe the people in the tavern. Veil is able to do much better than the men, although she does miss one nondescript woman in a corner who appears to be an informant. Ishnah coaches them in ways to observe and remember things. Vathah is learning the best of the three, seeming to enjoy this duty much more than other assignments. Veil realizes that she is late for a meeting and bolts, telling the others to keep practicing.</p>

      <p>Shallan arrives late at the meeting of the scribes. She feels anxious about being around such learned people, and briefly contemplates producing another persona to deal with it, but she dismisses the idea. Shallan should be the scholar. Navani calls the meeting to order. Renarin timidly joins the meeting. They start to discuss the fabrials of the tower, and he makes an insightful comment. Janala mocks him for his apparent knowledge in the feminine arts, and Shallan calls her out, insulting her in turn. Jasnah calls for a break and scolds Shallan for her outburst and expresses regret at taking on a ward. Shallan slinks off to the side. Renarin thanks her for defending his honor. He believes that the entire city is somehow an entire fabrial. He tells her that she can stand up to Jasnah more, or better yet, just not be around her. That gives her the idea to take off with Kaladin in the mission to Kholinar. The meeting starts up again, and Dalinar comes in to observe. Shallan realizes that he's done that to support his son being there.</p>

      <p>Moash is dropped off in Revolar by the Fused. He's forced into a pen with other humans, some obviously refugees of the Everstorm. He wanders about, earning hostile looks because of his threatening size. Only Bridge Four had ever accepted him as he was. Parshmen are organizing work details. They ask for "volunteers" for various jobs, but the human slaves don't eat if they don't work. Moash sees some caravaneers -- his old profession -- and asks for Guff. He finds him and asks for work. Guff realizes that Moash was trained as a soldier, so he brings him to Paladar, regent of Highprince Vamah. He asks Moash if anyone is coming to save him, and Moash is stunned that the same hierarchy exists even though they are all slaves. He just stands there, unable to answer, and Paladar orders Guff beaten for bringing him. Moash goes to volunteer for hard labor.</p>

      <p>Skar races up a ramp in Urithiru in full pack and equipment as part of Sigzil's tests of their abilities. Skar is slow because he still can't draw in Stormlight. They are all waiting for Kaladin to transport them to the Shattered Plains. Teft brings him some food and tries to encourage him. Skar aches to fight with the spear but knows he'll have to cook with Rock if he can't learn to Surgebind. Kaladin finally arrives; he has brought with him more recruits. He activates the Oathgate and they arrive in Narak. Waiting there is Ristina, a scribe, who reports that some merchants were annoyed at the delay. Kaladin snaps back that the Knights Radiant are not doormen. They pass some soldiers practicing with bridges and Skar thinks of how his unhealed slave brand further separates him from the others. They arrive at the original Bridge Four, now held permanently in place. Kaladin worries that none of the recruits have been drawing in Stormlight, so he's broadened his recruiting to increase the chances. Kaladin sends off the squires to practice flying. The recruits he works out in formations on Teft's suggestion. Skar is about to practice again with a gemstone but sees Lyn off by herself, obviously frustrated, and decides to go commiserate. He tells her of the first time he noticed Kaladin using Stormlight, using the Surge of Gravitation to divert arrows away from him. He didn't even know what he was doing, so maybe they were just trying too hard. Lyn desperately wants to fly with the Windrunners, but Skar tells her that that isn't enough. She has to want to protect, like Kaladin. She is finally successful in drawing in Stormlight. Skar is wistful but eventually becomes excited for Lyn's success. He tells Rock that he just might join the support team since he won't be able to fly, but Rock points out that he is glowing.</p>

      <p>Characters

      Ivory
      Shallan Davar (mentioned only)</p>

      <p>Plot Summary</p>

      <p>Jasnah reads the words of Talenel'Elin, who apparently really was the returned Herald rather than just a madman. Nearby are three spanreeds writing continuously. They are paired with spanreeds in Tashikk where scribes are writing up all of her backed up notes. Ivory also believes the writer to be Taln and agrees that they need to find him. He reports that Odium stirs and wants to destroy all mankind and spren like him. Jasnah's thoughts turn to a childhood illness with hints of a betrayal. She asks Ivory what he thinks of Shallan, and his opinion is that she is unstable -- even more so than most humans -- and that Cryptics are trouble. Jasnah believes that she should share what she learned from Wit, but Ivory objects, saying it will cause another Recreance. She decides to wait for now.</p>

      <p>Chapter 48: Rhythm of Work</p>

      <p>Characters
      Moash (point of view)</p>

      <p>Plot Summary</p>

      <p>Moash pulls at a cart with steel skids instead of wheels. It's easy compared to bridge duty. Hundreds of humans around him also pull wagons or sledges. It's obvious to Moash that they are marching to invade Kholinar. He starts to feel as though the humans didn't deserve to govern anyway. He admires the efficiency and fairness of the Parshendi army -- with one exception: a group of parshman slaves. They are whipped and treated poorly, set apart from all the other sledges.</p>

      <p>During a quick water break, Moash asks his overseer why that group of parshmen are treated so badly. She responds that they had harbored a "false god" (a Knight Radiant) and brought it among them. They continue on after the break, and after some time one of the exhausted parshmen slips and falls, causing their sledge to stop. Moash sees the whipping start again and gets fed up. He attacks the two overseers and takes the injured man's place. The overseers let it go, even after conferring with the Fused. No one whips the parshmen for the rest of the march.</p>

      <p>Plot Summary</p>

      <p>Twenty-three years ago</p>

      <p>Dalinar uses some firemoss to escape his quiet life with no battles or fighting. Havar and Bashin are with him and place bets on the wrestling match. Dalinar watches the match and begins to feel excited at the conflict, then he remembers that that almost led him to kill Gavilar. Havar asks when they are going to the Rift to fight the rebellious Tanalan, but Gavilar is trying diplomatic means. The feature match has been canceled due to one participant being sick, so Dalinar takes off his shirt and enters the ring. His opponent is the undefeated Makh, but he backs out for fear of being hurt. Havar explains that Dalinar maimed some men in a tavern fight a couple of weeks back, so no one wants to face him. The den empties and Toh arrives, looking for Dalinar. He reports that Evi is giving birth.</p>

      <p>Evi tells Dalinar that he has a son, and the midwives bring him in. He takes him in his arms and laughs in joy. He gives him a silent blessing: that he may inherit his strength and some of Evi's compassion. Looking at his son, he better understands Gavilar's thought for a stable future. He names him Adolin and is surprised to see Gavilar there. He congratulates Dalinar, but there is clearly something wrong, so they go apart to talk. Dalinar asks after Jasnah's "lunacy," but he says she's recovering. Instead, he's worried about the Rift, which is in true rebellion. Dalinar worries about going back to battle because he's an animal when he fights. Gavilar instead sends him to fight some other border disputes to show that they are determined to keep a united Alethkar.</p>

      Fen Rnamdi (mentioned only)</p>

      <p>Plot Summary</p>

      <p>Dalinar flies with Kaladin and some squires, Navani at his side. He marvels that Kaladin has enough control to fly at the edge of a highstorm, and the Stormfather speaks up, perceiving that he is thinking of him. Kaladin then touches all of them, and they all slow to stop, hanging in the air above warcamps. They take in the view, then Kaladin touches them all again, bringing them gently to the ground. The guard hurries them inside the camp, as the Parshendi have been seen nearby, and Dalinar gets a tour of his warcamp from Jasalai, the scribe left in charge. After a meal, Navani talks with Rushu about a proposed flying ship of some kind. The spanreed for Queen Fen starts blinking, and she says "yes" to visiting Urithiru. She had visited the Aharietiam vision on her own that morning. They make arrangements and Dalinar leaves the room. He wanders around the monastery and runs into Kadash. He tells him he's looking for the madman that was housed here. Kadash tells him which building and asks Dalinar if he really thinks he was a Herald. Dalinar believes it likely and asks him if he would accept his word if he agreed with Dalinar's heretical claims. Kadash would find it hard to change. He spies one of his spanreeds, which has just finished writing. It is from the Palanaeum, where scribes are using the Dawnchant clues Dalinar got from the visions. Dalinar exults that he believes that the visions are true, but Kadash is skeptical of the source. Dalinar goes to room 37, the madman's room, which is locked. He asks the Stormfather if he can use his powers, but they won't work here. He finally goes outside and sees a hole already cut out by a Shardblade in the outside wall. He searches the room and finds a dart. Kaladin arrives and identifies Blackbane poison on the tip. As they gather and leave the warcamp, Dalinar orders Kaladin to fly to Thaylen City in the next highstorm.</p>

      <p>Moash</p>

      <p>Moash and the other parshmen have been pulling the sledge for a few days on their way to Kholinar. They stop to rest in an orchard and Moash sees some of the Fused on horseback and not flying. He then comments to the parshmen that he's surprised the Fused have not just swept in and destroyed everything in their path as the legends have told. That the Fused are actually farming. Moash mentions in passing that he killed one of the Fused and Sah is baffled. The company heads out again and stops in a town nearby. Moash sees the Fused sending humans too weak to work in the fields to Kholinar. He realizes that the Fused are trying to overcrowd the city with refugees. Moash also realizes that they have stopped in this town for the siege because a highstorm would destroy an army on the plains. He and the punished parshmen are brought to a lumberyard to build siege ladders to use on Kholinar's walls. When the overseer sneers at him that he'll be in the front running the ladder towards Kholinar and the archers, Moash is overcome with laughter at the irony.</p>

      <p>Shallan</p>

      <p>Shallan reads another letter from Mraize. He tells her that Ishnah was an assistant to real spies, but not a threat and may continue to work for Shallan. While she waits for a meeting with Elhokar she examines the illusion she has placed on her pouch that makes it appear violet, but is actually white. The illusion is being sustained by the Stormlight of a sphere in the pouch, rather than by Stormlight from inside her. She ponders new applications of this ability. Shallan then meets with Elhokar. She tells him she's going to fly with Kaladin to Thaylen City. Then, in private, she offers the king her and her spies' company on the mission to Kholinar. Elhokar at first hesitates, not wanting to take two Radiants away from Dalinar. She convinces him that she is not Dalinar's subject and neither is he; he can do what he wishes. He accepts.</p>

      <p>Shallan tucks the formal request to help into her safepouch next to Mraize's letter. She tries to convince herself that she's not just running away from Jasnah. Pattern is humming, and Shallan hums with him.</p>

      <p>Eighteen and a half years ago</p>

      <p>Dalinar returns to his camp exhausted. He has spent the last four years on campaign, first crushing the Herdazians and now fighting the Vedens at Alethkar's western border. Kadash enters and reports on the battle. Dalinar thinks on battlefield tactics and logistics and senses the Thrill still within him. He realizes that he is glad the fighting has gone on for so long so he can continue feeling the Thrill. As he finally drifts off to sleep, he hears Evi's voice. She has been living in Kholinar for the past few years. At first he's angry that she's there, but she wants to be like the other Alethi wives and accompany her husband. She chides him for not visiting her more often; Renarin hasn't even met his father yet. Her healing touch calms him, and he goes to see his sons. Adolin is thrilled to see his father again and we see how much Adolin already looks up to Dalinar. Renarin is a toddler and merely looks at his father and plays with blades of grass. The Thrill finally leaves Dalinar. He promises Evi that they will discuss her role there later, and she leads him to a bed in her wagon to sleep.</p>

      <p>Plot Summary</p>

      <p>Jasnah ponders her recent readings about the history of Jah Keved. She is disturbed by the account of an ancient king slaughtering his entire family and court after many assassination attempts. She peeks into the library, now full of scholars. The hallway in which the Unmade had fled had been discovered to lead to an alternate exit into the mountains. Renarin is there, watching the scholars in his Bridge Four uniform. Jasnah worries about rebellion within the family, like the story about the king who ruled for only three months. She sees her spanreed light up, and she speaks to some fellow colleagues, Jochi and Ethid, via Tashikk. They report that they suspect that the Herald Nale has been seen. They relate the tale of Lift and Nale in the palace. Jasnah notices Navani talking to Shallan and goes over to them. Renarin looks strange. Suddenly, Amaram shows up in the doorway. He asks Jasnah to speak in private, but she declines, taking the opportunity to insult him. He was apparently Gavilar's choice for Jasnah's husband, and he tries to "rekindle" the relationship, which Jasnah insists never existed. She further insults him and his mother, implying she was a whore, and he starts to summon his blade. She smiles and dares him to continue, showing Stormlight leaking from her hand. He storms off and Shallan giddily congratulates her on being so clever. She then asks for permission to leave, saying that Elhokar needs her in case they have to sneak into the city. Jasnah wants to speak to Elhokar about that, then she suddenly notices that Renarin has opened a drawer with a strange gemstone inside. Shallan notices that it seems to buzz with a musical language. Renarin pushes Stormlight into the wall and hundreds of drawers open. The contents of the library have been preserved in the gems.</p>

      <p>Plot Summary</p>

      <p>Moash works on the ladders for the siege. Sah and Khen are resentful at their treatment, but don't know what to do about it. Their own gods have set them up to die in the first assault. Moash is also frustrated at their plight, knowing what it's like to be sent in to absorb arrows, and walks off into the town, demanding to talk to someone in charge. One of the flying Fused approaches and says he can talk to Lady Leshwi. It tows him up to the sky and leaves him hanging there. He floats over to Leshwi, and she asks him how he got his name, because "Moash" is a Parshendi name of old. She says that she is one of the "sane" Fused, so is the one in charge. He was spared because he showed such passion in fighting her (she was the one he had killed during his capture) and in helping the lesser Singers. He admits that he doesn't deserve the Shards that were taken from him, and also opines that the humans don't deserve to rule. He only wants vengeance.</p>

      <p>Later, he wanders the streets, set free by Leshwi. He ponders on the Fused, being reborn for thousands of years and never giving up. He goes back to the lumberyard and finds his forlorn crew. He offers to teach them the spear.</p>

      <p>Plot Summary</p>

      <p>Rlain attunes to the Rhythm of the Lost as he watches the Alethi soldiers repurpose his old home, Narak. As far as he knows, he is the only true listener left. He is trusted enough to hold a spear, but not enough to hold Stormlight. Even the newcomer Lyn seems more part of the group than he is. He goes over to the drink station where some bridgemen are discussing a recent raid by the Fused on a caravan. They ask Rlain what they're up to -- since he would know since they're his kin -- and he explains that the Fused are not his people. His people had tried to avoid them, and somehow they were tricked into bringing the Fused back. Kaladin and the rest of the patrols return, and they gather to drink Rock's latest concoction. They are uncomfortable with Renarin hanging out with the scholars, as it is too feminine, but have no trouble with Drehy courting a man, which confuses Kaladin. Rlain sympathizes; humans can't simply choose a form and act accordingly. Kaladin sends the men off for more training and offers the rest of the day off for Rlain, noticing his frustration. Rlain complains that Kaladin doesn't really know how he feels, so Kaladin offers to listen.</p>

      <p>Plot Summary</p>

      <p>Dalinar brings Navani and Jasnah into the Recreance vision without the aid of a highstorm. They try to figure out the time period by observing the weapons and architecture. Yanagawn has been brought into the vision as well, and he watches the Knights abandon their shards with interest. Dalinar feels the pain of the dying spren. Yanagawn shares his doubts about his own abilities; he is just a youth, placed on the throne because the viziers feared the Assassin in White. Dalinar again asks him to come to Urithiru. As usual, the Almighty gives the final speech associated with the vision, then Yanagawn fades away, but the vision does not. Dalinar calls for the Stormfather, but there is no answer. Turning about, he sees a man in white and gold clothing holding a golden scepter. Thinking that the Almighty (Honor) has appeared to him, he kneels. The man identifies himself as Odium.</p>

      The Stormfather (mentioned only)</p>

      <p>Plot Summary</p>

      <p>Odium settles down for a chat while Dalinar practically panics. He calls Odium a monster for killing Honor, but he retorts that Dalinar has behaved similarly in his life. Odium states his intention to kill Cultivation as well, but he can't right now because he is shackled. Dalinar suggests that he just go away and leave them alone. Odium asks if that's a serious offer made with Intent, and Dalinar asks why he can't just leave without killing. Odium uses examples from Dalinar's own campaigns; he has enemies to destroy, whether they are worthy of death or not. He explains that he is the god of passion, not just hate, and that he cares for people, unlike Honor and Cultivation, being only interested in oaths and transformation, good or bad. Dalinar asks why the Knights abandoned their oaths, but he doesn't answer directly. He starts to walk away, and Dalinar offers a challenge of champions. Odium declines to take that risk, confident that Dalinar will release him anyway. Dalinar tells him that he's not afraid of him anymore now that he has revealed himself. Odium smiles and plunges him into a vision of sorts, allowing Dalinar to experience Odium's true depth of power; the old man is just a mask. Dalinar is overwhelmed by the intense emotions he experiences and shrinks from the vision. Odium kindly tells him to rest then suddenly frowns, looking among the rocks. He disappears and Lift emerges. She agrees to come to Urithiru as long as the food is good. The vision finally fades.</p>

      <p>Plot Summary</p>

      <p>Kaza clings to the rigging as the First Dreams heads directly into a storm. After one last enormous wave, the storm suddenly stops, and Vazrmeb exults that forbidden treasure will soon be theirs. He takes the helm from Droz, who ignores Kaza's deformed appearance and starts to chat with her. She struggles to converse because she is forgetting how humans interact. The captain orders her to soulcast some of the stone spikes so they can approach the island in dinghies. She promises to comply but reminds him that she is here for her own purposes. They board four dinghies, and she begins to soulcast one of the spikes. In the midst of convincing the stone to turn into smoke, she almost turns herself into smoke to finally end her pain. Vazrmeb climbs into her dingy while the one he was in heads back; the men claim to be ill. She begins to feel slightly sick herself and a moment later notices that all of the sailors have collapsed. She determinedly grabs the oars herself and struggles to the shore, where she collapses, feeling sleepy. She crawls a bit further, passing an uncut gemstone among the remains of a greatshell, then collapses again. The cook appears behind her, and Kaza realizes they have all been poisoned. She asks what the secret of the island is, but the cook refuses to answer as even her soul could reveal the secret that would be "the ends of worlds." The cook's Dysian Aimian body collapses and some cremlings try to take the soulcaster from Kaza. She turns the ground beneath her and herself to smoke.</p>

      <p>Plot Summary</p>

      <p>Taravangian knows he is brilliant today and impatiently works the math problems. Only one problem eludes him; he is not quite at the level as the day he created the Diagram. He orders that his rooms be cleared of furniture and people and orders some background music. Adrotagia brings him a copy of the Diagram, and he settles down with the transcribed copy. He starts cutting it to pieces; the Diagram in this form might be misleading them, so he decides he needs to separate it back into its parts to see it in new ways. He connects different parts of the text and gains new insights. He notices a slip of paper under the door -- the measurements of the field outside his window he had ordered earlier. He opens the door and orders gum paste so he can start putting paper up on the wall. He fears that Adrotagia suspects that he pretended to be less intelligent, and he is right. She confronts him on the problem he skipped -- a ruse to allow him to make decisions. He deflects the conversation by sharing his calculations on how much food Urithiru could produce, based on the size of the field outside. They must have been able to grow food inside. She insists that he follow his own rules, and he impatiently agrees to make no more policy decisions for the day and kicks her out of the room. He tries to figure out a contingency for the failed assassination of Dalinar. He reads again the words the surgeon uttered at his birth. He had feared that since the cord was around his neck that he would have diminished capacity, which while not true, had become his reputation. After working for hours, a maid brings in food, and Adrotagia and Mrall check up on him. He has changed the Diagram such that it now directs them to support Dalinar then topple him, taking his place. They can use Malata's spren as a spy to find his weaknesses. Taravangian concludes that they cannot defeat Odium. He has been given the capacity to "save whatever they can."</p>

      <p>Venli awaits the Everstorm with eight others, including her friend and former mate, Demid. They have been chosen for something greater. Ulim coaches them. They must give themselves completely to what will happen. The storm arrives and something pushes against Venli's soul, demanding entrance. She screams in agony. She hears a kindly voice intervene, saying, "this one is mine." Something else enters. The storm subsides and Venli looks at her new form, which is less muscular, unlike the other eight. They start speaking in another language. Some act insane. Demid does not recognize her and treats her with derision. Ulim pulls her aside and explains that her companions are now Fused, inhabited by the souls of their gods. Demid has been replaced with Hariel, a notoriously vicious Fused. She pleads with Hariel to bring Demid back, but not even Odium could do so. He praises Venli for her perseverance in the war against the humans and tells her that Odium has a special purpose for her. She sits and waits while the Fused talk together in a strange language, and she sees the ball of light again, like the one near Eshonai's body. She instinctively hides it from the Fused.</p>

Shallan and Kaladin come through the Oathgate, successfully only transferring the control building instead of the entire platform. Kaladin reports that flying with the highstorm will work for the team's transport to Kholinar. Dalinar tells him that now that he is a shardbearer, he has been gifted lands by the king. Kaladin doesn't like the idea of that responsibility but is reminded that he took that upon himself by speaking the Words. Malata brings them to Thaylen City after some calculations by Navani. Once there, Dalinar is astounded at the level of destruction. Fen starts to take them on a tour.</p>

      <p>Plot Summary</p>

      <p>Fen brings them to the temple of Shalash. Dalinar wonders how the storm destroyed some of the faces of the statues inside the temple. They proceed to the temple of Battah at which a large statue has collapsed. The temple is filled with wounded since the hospitals are overrun. Taravangian pleads that she allow his surgeons to come to help, and she accepts. She insists that they can rebuild, but they lack labor since the parshmen left. Dalinar again offers the assistance of his troops. Fen doesn't respond, but her troops seem displeased, especially one who appears to be her son. They decide to skip to the end of the tour at the courtyard of Talenalet for some refreshments. Fen leaves them for a while on the pretense of attending to other business, so Dalinar takes the opportunity to make a display. He baits the man he supposes to be her son, and he demands a duel for the insult. He proposes an uneven match in which each has a sword and the other unarmed, each turn taking three minutes. First blood wins. Dalinar is first to go unarmed and manages to avoid being hit until 10 seconds remain, then he intentionally steps into his opponent's thrust. He heals himself with Stormlight and concedes the duel as the soldiers look on in amazement and fear. He suddenly regrets the stunt as unbecoming of Knight Radiant. He goes off to brood alone and rests against the broken walls of the temple. He hears many voices begging him to unite them, and he realizes the voices come from the wounded stones of the temple. He fills himself with all the Stormlight he has with him and heals the front wall of the temple. He tells a nearby scribe to send for Renarin.</p>

      <p>Fen finds Dalinar back at the temple of Battah, repairing the broken statue. Fen's son Kmakl and the other soldiers enthusiastically help, fetching missing body parts. Renarin is there healing. Dalinar once again asks for Fen to join him. She agrees to lend aid, but he insists that they join together as a coalition. She agrees and promises to help bring in the Azish as well.</p>

      <p>Kaladin flies above the highstorm with Elhokar's team. Shallan uses Stormlight to keep warm, but the others are bundled up. Skar and Drehy are flying below the team in case anyone falls. They pass the Windrunner River, so Kaladin knows they are close to Kholinar. He gives the team half lashings so they can slow down and talk. Kaladin drops down below the clouds to scout the city. He sees Alethi flags but senses something wrong about the palace complex. He reports back to Elhokar that the city is intact, so he wants to go directly in. Kaladin advises caution due to the troubling feeling he and Syl have, and Adolin backs him up. They decide to sneak in instead using disguises courtesy of Shallan.</p>

      <p>Plot Summary</p>

      <p>The team spends the night camped "inside" an illusion about a mile from the city. The Parshendi are allowing refugees in to drain the city of resources. Shallan disguises Kaladin and Adolin as old men -- Kaladin is ugly and wizened, Adolin is lean and attractive. She tells Elhokar that he'll be a woman, and he accepts without argument, being impatient to get into the city. They begin to walk in and he catches up to Kaladin. Elhokar expresses his doubts about his own abilities and charges Kaladin to get his wife and son out through the oathgate. He falls back to the others and Adolin approaches. He thinks they should hide and gather information rather than approach the palace directly. Adolin knows of a place near the palace, but not too close. As they approach the side door of the city, they see that it is being blocked by soldiers now. Elhokar struts to the gate and demands entry. The captain explains that the city is packed and that they are only allowed a certain number into the city each day under order from Highmarshal Azure. They offer them entrance if they can conscript Drehy and Skar. Syl suddenly zips away and a group of Voidbringers are seen in the sky. The soldiers run off to engage them, and the refugees take the opportunity to rush into the city. Kaladin feels like he should help in the fight -- as he is commissioned to protect -- but Adolin convinces him that it's only a raid to test the defenses. Kaladin reluctantly follows him in, and indeed the raid ends quickly. They enter the crowded city and make their way toward the safehouse. An odd procession of performers dressed as spren pass by. A refugee holding a baby attracts exhaustionspren, but they look wrong. Syl says they are from "him" and they hurry away. They go through a courtyard and Adolin knocks on the back door of his tailor. After Shallan removes his disguise, they invite them in.</p>

      <p>Plot Summary</p>

      <p>Shallan tries to draw out some painspren by punching herself, but she can't bring herself to do it hard enough. The others are sitting in the showroom, Yokska updating the king on the erratic behavior of his wife. Shallan spies some scissors and stabs herself, bringing the painspren. They are twisted, monster-like, and green instead of orange. Elhokar blames his wife's behavior on the "dark spren" that came after the Everstorm. Shallan continues to sketch as she listens. She draws a hungerspren she'd seen earlier, but it had looked normal. The tailor tells them that the queen had ordered the execution of the parshmen, but the order was blocked by important lighteyes in the city. They were eventually exiled outside the city by the Wall Guard. Meanwhile, Shallan tries to think of something really embarrassing, and she unbuttons her safehand sleeve. During a pause in the conversation, she trips and sprawls out on the floor, showing her legs and exposed safehand. Shamespren appear, also altered from their normal form. She scurries off to draw them. Yokska continues: a new highmarshal of the Wall Guard arrived and restored order, but they mostly just guard the wall, leaving the Cult of Moments to rule the city. Use of any type of fabrial attracts screaming yellow spren, which draw some Fused who then confiscate the fabrial. Kaladin presses her for more information, but Shallan perceives that she is overwhelmed, so she is dismissed to rest. Elhokar is determined to stay and do something to save the city and his family. They decide to stay and at least scout out the city. Elhokar will send a message to his wife at the palace via Shallan, disguised as a message girl. Kaladin is to accompany her in case of emergency. Shallan goes to her room to change into Veil. Since she obviously wasn't with them, Shallan is forced to reveal the truth to her guards.</p>

      <p>Shallan waits until she is away from the tailor shop before transforming to Veil in case the Surgebinding brings the screaming spren. She Lightweaves without incident. As she strolls through the streets, she sees poor refugees and another group of cultists dressed as rotspren. She wanders for some time, eventually getting closer to the palace, where the feeling of wrongness returns. She disguises herself as Lyn (while still remaining Veil) and approaches the oathgate. It is guarded by cultists. She hears strange sounds, like screams, coming from the platform. She finds Kaladin and he gives her the king's letter. He points out that the guards are acting strangely -- they are standing completely still, like statues. Veil tells Kaladin to stay there while she delivers the letter so they both aren't entrapped. She climbs the steps to the palace and announces that she has a letter from the Shattered Plains for the queen. The captain takes the letter from her, and she protests that she is supposed to deliver it personally, when one of the guards stabs her with a sword. She collapses to the floor and the captain simply returns to his post. She pretends to die, but uses just enough Stormlight to stay alive. A guard slings her over his shoulder and carries her away. As she's carried through the hall, she passes a mirror, in which she sees a shadowy figure with white eyes look in surprise at her. She's deposited in a room with a few other rotting corpses. She slips out of the room and disguises herself as a servant. She finds a door leading out and has Pattern check for guards. There are two outside, so she has Pattern imitate the voice of their captain, calling them. They walk away. She exits the palace and hides by a nearby building, telling Pattern to fetch Kaladin. After he tries to check her wounds, they go back to the safehouse.</p>

He reveals that he knows where Ishar is, and Dalinar figures out that he's Tezim. Stormfather explains that Dalinar has the powers of Ishar, Binder of the Gods, the power of Connection. Only two others can have his powers -- powers that come from his "siblings." Dalinar asks him if he can infuse a sphere, and the Stormfather tries, but fails. Dalinar gives the honorblade to Bridge Four so they can practice while Kaladin is gone.</p>

      <p>Navani and Fen prepare Dalinar for his visit to the Azish, which he feels he should do alone, despite the risk. As he walks to the Oathgate, he encounters a training exercise between Sadeas's and Aladar's troops which is getting out of hand. He shouts them down and uses Adhesion to stop the fighting. Aladar's men make an orderly retreat, but Sadeas's troops are sullen and angry. He meets Jasnah at the Oathgate where they decide to send them to Thaylenah to help with the restoration efforts to keep them busy. She sends him to Azir.</p>

      <p>Dalinar arrives to a contingent of soldiers and several viziers and scions. He immediately presents the first essay from queen Fen, and they read and discuss it among themselves. He asks the Stormfather for help in understanding their language, so he guides him on how to do it. He touches one of the soldiers and uses Spiritual Adhesion to make a Connection. He can now understand and speak Azish. The lead vizier, Noura, is impressed that he has learned their language, but is about to dismiss him anyway. He proffers another essay, this time by Navani. She offers economic and technological benefits. He then gives them an essay by Jasnah. They are extremely impressed by the form of the writing, calling it a work of art. Dalinar persuades them to let him stay longer, and they agree to talk to the Prime and his council.</p>

      <p>Dalinar is led to a small but comfortable room where he is to wait. He decides to eat some of the food sent with him, and he discovers that it's already eaten. Lift is there eating one of his sausages. He learns that she is an Edgedancer, and she perceives that he's been to see the Nightwatcher because he "smells" like her. They eat quietly together for a while until Noura returns. They have accepted his offer of a visit to Urithiru. Several dignitaries and bureaucrats will be coming. Dalinar thanks her and is escorted back to the Oathgate. Noura expresses surprise at Dalinar's approach, saying that she instead expected an "animal" of war and blood. This triggers a memory in Dalinar, and after he is transported back he suddenly remembers everything about the Rift.</p>

      <p>Dalinar discusses strategy with his son Adolin, now twelve years old, inside a newly conquered keep in the highlands near Jah Kaved. The fighting here is dying down, but he knows that the next target will be the Rift to quell another rebellion. Evi comes into the room and lets him know that Gavilar is sending a message via spanreed. Adolin is dismissed to attend to his studies. A messenger comes with the letter, and Evi reads it aloud. Gavilar informs him that a treaty has been signed and congratulates him on his accomplishments in the field. He is held in high esteem by the king's generals. He instructs Dalinar to proceed to the Rift to address the rebellion of Tanalan, just as he expected. Evi is distraught that he's going onto yet another campaign and scolds him for not ever being with Renarin, the son that he almost forgets about because of his disability. He tells her that they will probably never settle in Kholinar, and she starts crying. Dalinar is surprised -- he thought she was growing comfortable with the other women. He offers to take her to her homeland, but she is in exile from her own people -- they would attack. He finally concedes to go back to Kholinar for at least one year after the Rift.</p>

      <p>Plot Summary</p>

      <p>Shallan has mostly recovered a day after being "murdered" in the palace, though she is still bothered by the Unmade that she saw in the mirror. She, Adolin, Kaladin, and Elhokar hold a meeting in Yokska's kitchen while the building's owners are out buying food. Elhokar decides that Shallan will infiltrate the Cult of Moments to get close to the Oathgate, and he and Adolin will rally the lighteyed houses in the city to assault the palace if she fails. Meanwhile, Kaladin is to investigate Azure and the Wall Guard. Adolin compliments Elhokar on his plan, but he points out that Aesudan's bizarre behavior started before the Everstorm. Elhokar insists that something must have gone wrong -- she was proud but never gluttonous. He asks for their thoughts on the plan, and they agree to proceed.</p>

      <p>Shallan, as Veil, walks on the streets in disguise, trying to get a feel for the city's atmosphere. She notes that the market is quieter than it normally would be, due to everyone feeling like they are under siege. She stops to chat with a woman in a tailor's stall, finding out more about the current situation. Some order is still kept by Velalant's soldiers. Veil finds grain being distributed at a former Thaylen bank called Secure Keeps. Velalant's soldiers appear disorganized, allowing some to get in line more than once. She gives a stick of meat to an urchin, then asks him some questions regarding the food line. She learns that the soldiers seem to be purposely excluding many of the poor while giving food to servants of wealthier lighteyes. She tries to find out more by giving the boy another stick of meat, but he has run off. The line closes, to the ire of the poor who haven't gotten food. She is frustrated and wishes she could do something for them. She turns to leave, but then hears a familiar voice. She approaches it and sees Wit telling a story about the moon Mishim. After he finishes the story, the gathered people plead for more, but he refuses to say more. Soon only he and Veil are left. She spies a sealed jar in his pack, which he quickly shuts, then offers to let her buy him some food.</p>

      <p>He leads her to an inn and they are admitted to a private dining area. Wit compliments Shallan on her disguise. She probes him for information on who he is, suspecting that he's a Herald. He claims to be much older than them. Shallan looks into his eyes and sees eons of time passing. He has made a vow to be "there" when he is needed. They banter, and it comes out that Sadeas has been murdered. Wit is disappointed that he wasn't around for that. He does know that he needs to be in the city, but doesn't know why. The innkeeper brings some food, and Shallan eats while Wit seems distracted. She tells him that she wants to be like him, to be able to change the world. He cautions her to be careful with power and to be wary of anyone who claims to see the future. She asks him about the cult on the Oathgate platform. The Unmade known as the Heart of the Revel is there, and every night the members feast. If she can obtain non-soulcast food, she may be able to join the party. Wit makes an abrupt exit, and she asks Pattern if he knows who Wit is, and he says that he feels like one of them.</p>

      <p>Plot Summary</p>

      <p>Kaladin lashes a small stone with a tiny bit of Stormlight. The inhuman screeching starts soon after. He exhales the rest of his Stormlight and mixes in with the crowd in the plaza. Shallan and Adolin are there with him to observe. The spren look confused, unable to pinpoint the location of the Surgebinding. A Fused shows up and appears to scold them. The spren disappear and the Fused stays a bit longer, eventually leaving. They return to the tailor shop.</p>

      <p>Kaladin gripes about the lighteyes having parties while the city is besieged, and Skar and Drehy point out that darkeyes have dances during war. Adolin enters the room, beaming at his new outfit provided by Yokska. Elhokar also arrives, eager to get on with the business at hand, and calls for disguises. Kaladin refuses a new face, but the king insists on at least covering up his slave brands. They all head out into the city, Adolin chatting with Skar and Drehy. Kaladin hangs back a bit, and Adolin joins him. Kaladin regrets not bringing a spear with him, and Adolin tries to persuade him to train more with the sword since he won't know what he'll face as a Radiant. Kaladin agrees and decides that Adolin is a good person despite his silly outfits. They arrive at the house with the party. Elhokar and Adolin will seek out lighteyed allies in the party proper, Skar and Drehy will try to gather intelligence in the darkeyed feast, and Kaladin will try to find out about Highmarshal Azure in the lower-ranked lighteyed section. They split up, and Kaladin decides to continue to the wall itself and come back later. On the way, he is stopped by a wall guard patrol and offered a meal, despite his slave brand which has strangely defeated the disguise. Kaladin accepts, hoping to learn more about the wall guard.</p>

      <p>Plot Summary</p>

      <p>Kaladin sits down in the barracks and immediately feels at home. The lieutenant who brought him in, Noro, asks him for his story as he's given a bowl of stew. Kaladin gives some information but holds back on the whole story. Noro continues his recruiting effort but doesn't press too hard. Kaladin notices that everyone in the room is a lighteyes, and it finally hits home that plenty of them are just regular people. The men tell him about Azure, how Azure rallied the troops against the Cult of Moments. Azure used some sort of Shardblade and the men felt like they had Spren helping them. Azure enters to make the normal rounds for the evening, and Kaladin sees that she is very obviously a female. She greets Kaladin and encourages him to join -- they always have food. Kaladin is still reluctant, so Azure takes him out to look at the wall.</p>

      <p>Azure leads Kaladin up onto the wall. As they walk, Azure guesses that Kaladin wound up in Sadeas's border army rather than on the Shattered Plains, so she doesn't blame him for deserting. Azure says she won't press Kaladin into the guard, but that at least with them, he'll have a chance at defending the city and turning back the Voidbringers. Kaladin leaves them and goes back to the mansion to chat with the lighteyes there, but he doesn't find out anything. Kaladin's brands are fully visible even though his sphere is still infused. Elhokar and Adolin join Kaladin (their illusions still intact), and Kaladin reports that he may have found another Radiant.</p>

      <p>Eleven years ago</p>

      <p>Dalinar marches toward the Rift from the west while Sadeas's forces march in from the east. He rides behind Evi's wagon, where she continually burns incense and glyphs. He regrets their earlier exchange and decides to join her. She begs him to try to avoid bloodshed. She sees a great man, but he becomes a bloodthirsty monster in battle with a terrible empty look in his eyes (i.e. when he's taken with the Thrill). The carriage stops and he receives Teleb's report. A caravan was observed leaving the city, but they did not engage it. He commands the troops to form up and goes alone toward the city wall. Tanalan eventually comes out to talk to him. Dalinar tries to convince him to surrender, or at least try to reduce bloodshed by having a duel decide the battle. Tanalan declines, knowing he'd probably lose, but does propose the idea that they can pretend that they were allies in secret so that disloyal highprinces could be rooted out (because they would join Tanalan's supposed rebellion). He says that Sadeas was the one in the caravan. Dalinar rides back, and Teleb reports that someone with Shardplate is in the caravan. Dalinar decides that he can't risk sending conventional troops against someone with shards, so he must go with them. He tells Evi to send a message to Gavilar, that the Rift may be taken without bloodshed, and to trust no one.</p>

      <p>Veil and Vathah sneak into a mansion, following Red, who is already inside and runs reconnaissance. They pass a series of waterfalls soulcast into different materials. They pass Ishnah, disguised as a rug merchant, talking with Brightness Nananav regarding a replacement rug. They duck into a room to avoid guards, and Shallan draws her memory of Nananav. She creates a diversion for the guards and emerges from the room as Nananav. She concentrates on getting into character, adopting an attitude of arrogance to the point of feeling utter disdain for her team members. She pulls back and proceeds to the storeroom where she sees a master servant. She berates and punishes him for an insufficient bow and demands he unlock the door. They enter, and Vathah starts gathering sausages into a sack. She starts contemplating murdering the "inferior" version of Nananav and replacing her, so she drops the disguise, shaken. They load the sacks on a dumbwaiter and hurry out. They load the food on the wagon, and Veil spots some angerspren coming from the direction of the larder. They beat the chull into movement, but Nananav catches up to them yelling for guards. Veil stands up in the wagon and puts on the Nananav disguise. The real Nananav screams and runs away, but a crossbow bolt takes "Nananav" in the head. She appears to melt away, frightening away the guards. She changes back to Veil and passes out when Vathah pulls the bolt free. After coming to, completely healed, she decides to head to the market first to give some food to her urchin contact, Grund. She asks him about the book she wants (for information on The Heart of the Revel), but he has nothing for her. She asks who else could use some food, and he suggests several people. She goes around delivering all the food to get the Cult's attention.</p>

      <p>Kaladin is on patrol along the inside of the wall. He's been assigned to Noro's squad. The men chat amiably; Kaladin has been easily accepted into the group by the others. They see some noble dressed in a ridiculous outfit and make jokes about him. It turns out to be Adolin, who gives a subtle signal to Kaladin to stay with the guard. As they talk, Kaladin learns that even among lighteyes there are distinct castes. Those of the lower dahns call those of the higher dahns "middlers" and do not associate with them. They eventually meet up with some other squads to guard Velalant's food wagon. The starving refugees get increasingly hostile, but fortunately Velalant's guards show up and push back the crowds. Noro's squad is assigned to the wall in half an hour, and Kaladin and Beard climb to the station. Kaladin asks him how they are getting food. The only clue is that Azure had them attack a monastery that has a soulcaster, but they don't know why the screamers don't give it away. They reach the top of the wall, and Kaladin notices that the portion near the palace is lightly patrolled. Beard says that they hear whispers to join the palace guard when they go near there; Azure has told them to not listen, and they won't get sucked in. As the rest of the squad arrives, alarm drums sound. Kaladin starts giving orders, then feels stupid because he's not in command. They form a pike block and see the Fused engaging other troops some distance away. Some men start to break out of formation to go help, and Kaladin has to hold his tongue until Noro finally says something. The assault is very brief and never gets to them. Kaladin apologizes to Noro, but Noro doesn't seem to mind.</p>

      <p>Plot Summary</p>

      <p>Veil makes her usual rounds, giving food to Grund and Muri. She is gaining a reputation as a "Swiftspren," a spren robbing the rich and giving the food to the poor. She enhances this reputation by sending Ishnah and Vathah, wearing illusions, to look like Veil. She notices a Cult of Moments procession and joins them, creating an illusion shaped like the one she saw on the Wind's Pleasure. She gets caught up in the chanting but is jarred by a voice in her mind saying "Shallan, I'm not your enemy." She breaks free and, continuing under the illusion of a spren, tells the cultists to stop worshiping spren and go home. Shaken, she realizes that she wants to be a hero too much and it stops her from being logical like Jasnah. She hears genuine laughter and goes toward it, finding Wit leading people in song. She heads back to the tailor's shop.</p>

      <p>She struggles to return as Shallan because Veil wants to go flirt with Kaladin. She finds Elhokar sipping wine in the kitchen. He recognizes the pattern on her dress and idly asks about it. He confides that he also desires to be a hero. Shallan sketches an image of what Elhokar could be, noble and regal, which nearly brings him to tears. As she goes upstairs, Ishnah hands her a note securing her access to a feast at the palace.</p>

      <p>Dalinar leads a group of archers to ambush the Caravan carrying the traitor. He spots men in Sadeas's uniforms and charges down the canyon towards the caravan. Right into a trap. A landslide wipes out his troops and nearly shatters his shardplate. He crawls from the rubble, the Thrill engulfing him. The eyes of the soldiers surrounding him seem to glow with the Thrill, and they attack.</p>

      <p>The battle consumes Dalinar, and when he regains his senses, he's smashing the head of a man repeatedly, surrounded by corpses. Badly wounded and plate heavily damaged, he trudges back to his camp. The men there are astounded at his return, having received the message that all were dead. Dalinar realizes it was all a trap from the start. The scouts who relayed that a caravan left were traitors. Sadeas and Dalinar don't want to besiege the city; they want all the inhabitants to be punished - men, women, and children. Evi tries to pacify Dalinar, but he orders the soulcaster to make as much oil as possible. He intends to burn the entire town for their broken oaths.</p>

      <p>Plot Summary</p>

      <p>Eleven years ago</p>

      <p>Dalinar can't sleep, being consumed with the Thrill. He hardly even feels pain, or anything else besides a burning deep down. Messengers emerge from the city bearing a flag of truce. He orders that they be shot by the archers. Sadeas and Dalinar keep back messengers from the king so they can go forward with their plan and give Gavilar plausible deniability. Sadeas assures Dalinar that he does not want to be king and questions why Dalinar thought he had betrayed him. Dalinar admits that he once wanted to rule but realized that the man needed for this atrocity and the man to rule could not be the same person. They attack at night and secure a foothold on the wall. Dalinar orders the city to be burned. Teleb tries to convince him that innocents would die, but Sadeas retorts that this would eventually save lives in the future because there would be no more rebellion. Oil is dumped on the already flammable city and set ablaze. He leads Kadash to a saferoom on the outside of the city where he assumes Tanalan is hiding and sets it ablaze with barrels of oil. Walking away from the screaming within, he spots Tanalan trying to reach the palace instead. He pleads to Dalinar to let him save his family, but Dalinar (still bothered by the screams earlier in the saferoom) admits he is an animal and he will not be so foolish as to allow survivors again. As the palace collapses, Tanalan's family dead, Dalinar decides it is enough and allows the remaining people to flee. As he moves to execute Tanalan, he comments that at least Tanalan didn't hide in that hole but he had set afire the people who were there. Tanalan laughs. The messengers that Dalinar killed at the start of the day were to tell him they had imprisoned his wife in the safehouse, which was now a prison since everyone knew about it. Dalinar strangles him to death in a fury. Kadash vomits at the realization of what they've done. Dalinar orders soldiers back to the hole, but the heat is too much. They are forced back, and Dalinar goes limp.</p>

      <p>Evi's burned corpse is brought back to camp. She had drugged her guard and sneaked away in the night, leading people to suspect that she was a traitor. He swears the scribes to secrecy and instead has them hide her burned body. They lie that she was assassinated in the night and the city was burned as retribution. As Dalinar leaves, he hears the screams of the innocent the night before and thinks he even hears Evi.</p>

Adolin shares that Elhokar is doing better than expected at convincing lighteyes to join him. Kaladin states that he thinks Captain Azure might have an honorblade. They definitely have a soulcaster and seized emerald stones in the city. Judging the state of Kaladin's issued sword, Adolin is impressed by her. Shallan has found information on the Unmade and believes there are two in the city: Sja-anat, the Taker of Secrets, and Ashertmarn, the Heart of Revel. The former corrupting spren and the latter leading people to indulge in excess. Shallan plans to infiltrate the palace that night. They all realize their dire situation as the city's fall is inevitable without the Oathgate open.</p>

      <p>Shallan</p>

      <p>Shallan and Adolin leave the wine house and walk through the streets arm in arm. Adolin complains that he hasn't seen any of her sketches for a while, so she hands him one of her sketchbooks. He is impressed with her drawings of the various refugees. He studies a sketch of himself in his new suit and Shallan takes the book back, knowing that the next drawing is of Kaladin. They part ways so she can steal some food as payment to the cult. Shallan changes into Veil and meets Vathah to go over the details of their food heist. The barkeep bursts into their room to try to figure out what they're up to, and Vathah unconsciously disguises himself with Stormlight. After the barkeep is dismissed, and he realizes what he has done and what he might be, he is brought to the verge of tears.</p>

      <p>Plot Summary</p>

      <p>Shallan</p>

      <p>Veil is uptight that her enemies know her identity. She considers creating a new persona but rejects the idea. She takes the wagon of food to the meeting point with the cult. She and Vathah meet two guards and a woman with a mask by the steps to the Oathgate platform. The woman disapproves of Vathah's presence and the fact that Veil reserved two bags of food to give to the poor instead of the cult. She remarks that Veil had been leaving rumors throughout the city that she wanted to join the cult, and Veil realizes that it was Wit's work. Veil tells them that she hears a voice telling her to give in to the end and embrace the "time of the spren", and the cult members allow her to enter.</p>

      <p>Kaladin</p>

      <p>Kaladin stands on top of the wall, observing the city after the Everstorm. He feels that things are wrong somehow. Beard and some of the others come up to call him in for dinner, and Kaladin joins them in the barracks. The platoon commanders call the men to muster, and Azure enters the room. She does a formal inspection, and Kaladin reflects on how these inspections are less about finding flaws and more of a chance for the men to show off. Azure compliments them as the "finest platoons" she's led, helping to boost morale. Kaladin sits at the officers' table, having been invited to sit there, but he is away from the center. When one of the captains excuses himself, he takes his seat.</p>

      <p>Shallan</p>

      <p>Veil steps up to the platform and meets her guide/guard, Kharat. He gives her a new name (Kishi) and leads her to the outer circle where there is a feast laid out. People mill about feasting with their bare hands, many with a glassy look to their eyes. Some go into the small monastery buildings to have sex. She tries to go into the inner circle so she can see the Oathgate, but Kharat holds her back; she's not allowed in there on her first visit. She hears the voice whispering in her mind to let go and enjoy. She drags him to an empty room so she can "rest" and uses Pattern's "voice" to lure him away momentarily for a drink. She leaves an illusion of herself and changes into "Kishi," modeled after a woman in the market, and heads into the inner circle as Kharat guards her illusory Veil.</p>

      <p>Kaladin</p>

      <p>Kaladin sits across from Azure and starts questioning her. He asks her why she's so cavalier with her Shardblade, hanging nearby on the wall. She probes him for his background as well, but dodges her questions. She tires of his hinting and asks him directly what he wants to know. He asks why everyone is pretending that she's a woman, then she asks him if he was chasing after her. Before he can answer her curious question, the alarm sounds. The wall is under attack.</p>

      <p>Shallan</p>

      <p>The next ring in was full of people crawling about enthralled with various emotions. The food on the tables is rotten. She almost gives in to the desire to lose herself in the Revel, but Pattern's hum snaps her back. She heads to the control building and finds a dark mass covering it. She hears a different voice in her mind now, warning her of a trap. She looks down and sees her shadow pointing the wrong way, creeping up the wall. She hears the drums warning of the attack, and she scampers back to the outer circle and leaps off the platform.</p>

Kaladin organizes a defense, but the Fused fly in from all directions, making it difficult to hold a formation. One Fused swoops down and Lashes Kaladin, trying to turn him into a weapon. He manages to "fall" into a guard house, avoiding hitting the soldiers. He leaps out of the room and grabs onto a Fused. He spirals up in the air, and Kaladin stabs him with a Syl-knife. They continue to struggle, twisting and turning in the air; the Fused is not affected by the wound. Syl tells him to go for the heart, so he thrusts upward, hitting something hard and brittle, and the Fused dies. They crash down back on the wall some fifty feet from where they started. Kaladin is forced to use Stormlight to heal. He reports to Azure and she points out that the entire army is coming. He reveals his Shardblade and says he's there on orders from the king to save the city.</p>

He takes a bite of the bread and tries to bluff her into staying. She promises to come back with more food and leaves him, walking through the market disguised as a guard. She circles back to Grund and hears thugs beating him. She scares them off but not before one of them bashes Grund in the head. She tries to tend to his wounds, but as she does, he reveals that he actually hates her because the "Grips" gang forced him to wait around for food and would just steal it from him. All of those who she thought she was helping hate her. Grund dies, and she rushes to Muri, who is escaping the area because the Grips are mad about something. She curses Shallan and leaves with her children. Shallan crumples to the floor in anguish.</p>

      <p>Adolin freshens up after a long night of worrying. He summons his Shardblade and thanks it. He promises to use it for good. He returns to the others as they plan the assault on the palace. The Windrunners are tasked with getting the queen and Elhokar's son out. Shallan will try to distract the Fused and somehow defeat the Unmade blocking the Oathgate. They hear drums announcing the assault, and they march. As they arrive at the palace, a Thunderclast climbs up the city walls, sweeping men off the wall like cremlings. It hurls a boulder at them, and Kaladin flies up to it and Lashes back in its direction, missing it. Shallan and the Windrunners go off to fight the Fused; Azure and Adolin charge the palace with their small army. The tower guard retreats inside and closes the doors, but Adolin's and Elhokar's Shardblades cut through the doors and walls to allow them in. Azure cuts her way in as well, using her shorter blade to slice enemy spears. Adolin charges in with his Shardblade, cutting down dozens and breaking the defensive formation. The enemy regroups, blocking the eastern gallery. The noise outside has subsided; the parshmen have apparently broken through and will be heading to the palace. Azure orders her men forward to try to break through. Meanwhile, Adolin and Elhokar cut through a door locked from the outside and find "traitor" palace guards who wouldn't obey the queen. Adolin starts hearing a voice in his head that cuts to his soul, glorying in the sweet passion of the battle. Azure's men have finally broken the defenders, and after they retreat, Kaladin and his squires appear, glowing brilliantly, announcing that the gallery is secure. Elhokar leads a force up to the royal chambers to get his family; Kaladin goes with him. Shallan summons her Shardblade and proceeds toward the Oathgate platform. Adolin clears the enemy out with his Shardblade with some help from Skar. They reach the control room and see the Unmade. Shallan walks forward to engage it.</p>

Elhokar tries to stir their memories of their king, trying to break them from the spell they seem to be under. They break ranks and retreat after hearing a voice. Syl reports that the queen is inside the royal chambers. They hear her singing and enter.</p>

      <p>Shallan</p>

      <p>Shallan approaches the wrong-looking purple heart. She tries to destroy it with her Shardblade, but it has no effect. She decides to try what she did before, and touches it with her hand. She is swept away.</p>

      <p>Kaladin</p>

      <p>The queen acts normally at first and says that Gavinor is off playing with friends. Syl tells Kaladin where he really is, in the room, and he heads that way. Elhokar tries to get the queen to come away with him from the evil influence in the palace, but she just calls him a fool. Meanwhile, Kaladin finds Gav huddling in a corner being attacked by strange red spren. He summons Syl and stabs one of them, killing it. Syl is amazed that they have killed a spren. The queen boasts of her "Radiants" in the palace and that she has bonded with ancient spren, something Gavilar hadn't discovered. Her eyes start glowing red. Elhokar gathers up his son and they flee the queen. She calls for her soldiers to attack.</p>

      <p>Shallan</p>

      <p>The spren implores Shallan to "give me your passion," and Shallan takes on many identities as the voices suggest different emotions. She hears Wit's voice tell her that she can be all of those people, and she screams to him for help. The darkness suddenly withdraws, and the enormous heart oozes away. Adolin and Azure prepare for the counter-assault with the army on the other end of the Oathgate. Shallan goes into the control room and sees a strange woman in the mirror. She introduces herself as Sja-anat.</p>

      <p>Shallan</p>

      <p>Sja-anat insists that she is not Shallan's enemy and that she is no longer of Odium. But she was compelled to mess with the spren controlling the Oathgate, creating a trap. She begs Shallan to not activate the device.</p>

      <p>Kaladin</p>

      <p>Kaladin sees friends on both sides, fighting and killing each other. He loses the will to fight and yells at them to stop. He sinks to his knees, distraught, then remembers that he needs to get Elhokar out. Kaladin sees Elhokar holding his son and the sketch of Elhokar that Shallan had done. Elhokar haltingly starts to say the Words, but is interrupted when Moash runs Elhokar through with a spear. Moash salutes Kaladin with the Bridge Four salute. The queen arrives surrounded by black smoke with strange crystal formations forming on her body. Drehy and Skar suddenly arrive and drive away the soldiers. Adolin pulls Kaladin away.</p>

The general tells him that he can either face the sword, where all the women he abused can take a turn at beheading him; the hammer, in which his arms and legs are broken and he is hung up from a cliff by the ocean; or the hog, in which he is greased and has to wrestle a hog. As the general explains, Sheler protests at his treatment, arguing that he was gathering resources because his homeland was under attack and demanding right of ransom, but he is told that ransom is not available since he was caught robbing and killing civilians. Sheler chooses the hog and is doused in foul-smelling oil. As an enormous claw breaks the surface of the ocean, he thinks that the "hog" may have been more of a nickname.</p>

      <p>Plot Summary</p>

      <p>Venli sits in her room in a stormshelter just outside Kholinar. She is required to say her speech several times a day and is not allowed in the city. She wonders if perhaps she can become a Fused. Her little spren, which she has named Timbre, pleads with her to resist Odium. She wishes Eshonai were in her place, because she would do the right thing, not just lust for power as she had. The Everstorm arrives, and she leaves her window open. She has a vision of Odium overwhelming her, burning her body, and upbraiding her for her restlessness. He affirms that she belongs to him. She collapses on the floor and tells Timbre that she has the wrong sister. She can't resist Odium.
